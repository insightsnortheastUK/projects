# Innovation Corridor

INE was commissioned to scope the potential of an innovation corridor between Edinburgh (and the South of Scotland) and Newcastle Upon Tyne (and the North East of England).
An innovation corridor is a designated area planned to enhance regional development. As a new type of spatial organisation, it represents a strategic approach to encourage collaboration in policy coordination, focusing on synergy rather than competition. In this sense, corridors are a planning strategy for coordinating policies across different jurisdictions in a given area. The innovation corridor implies a collaborative logic which goes beyond administrative boundaries. The final product of this project will be a report gathering evidence on the potentials and obstacles of an innovation corridor in the region. In this sense, we need to provide data visualisations and analysis of conditions that would foster collaboration between the two city regions and potential benefits.
Previous reports and feasibility studies on similar initiatives highlight the following elements:
•	Distance and connectivity: transport infrastructure is key to allowing collaboration between the two regions. In this sense, we must analyse the routes linking Edinburgh and Newcastle. This is done through plotting roads and rail systems in maps (using Geographical Information Systems – GIS).
•	Economic indicators: an innovation corridor would help cities to enjoy their complementarities. In this sense, we
•	Innovation clusters: agglomerations of companies and organisations (concentration in a single region) attract investment and facilitate industrial growth. Hence, it is important to identify the location of companies in strategic sectors (ex., education, transport and storage). We did a previous exercise with the sectors 'renewable energy' and 'pharmaceuticals'.
•	Research and development: the presence of universities and collaborations between them are relevant for the success of this initiative. Several corridors were led or supported by recognised higher education institutions (e.g., Florida High Tech and Route 128 in the US, Cambridge Arch in the UK). Graduate flows are also an important data to identify potential collaboration between two cities.


## Goals:
The main goal is producing data visualisations for local policymakers, allowing them to understand the potential benefits of an innovation corridor in the region. This includes:
-	Comparison of economic indicators: foreign direct investment, employment, etc
-	Transport links and human flows (passengers and graduates)
-	Companies' agglomerations (strategic sectors)

## Products
- Data visuals: exploratory analysis of economic indicators, sectors, and graduate outcomes
- Report
