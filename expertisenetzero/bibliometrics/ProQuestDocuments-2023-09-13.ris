T1  - How and why to use ‘vulnerability’: an interdisciplinary analysis of disease risk, indeterminacy and normality
AN  - 2863421237
AB  - In recent years, ‘vulnerability’ has been getting more traction in theoretical, professional and popular spaces as an alternative or complement to the concept of risk. As a group of science and technology studies scholars with different disciplinary orientations yet a shared concern with biomedicine, self and society, we investigate how vulnerability has become a salient and even dominant idiom for discussing disease and disease risk. We argue that this is at least partly due to an inherent indeterminacy in what ‘vulnerability’ means and does, both within and across different discourses. Through a review of feminist and disability theory, and a discussion of how vulnerability and disease both get recruited into a binary conceptualisation of normal versus abnormal, we argue that vulnerability’s indeterminacy is, in fact, its strength, and that it should be used differently than risk. Using COVID-19 management in the UK as an illustration of the current ambivalence and ambiguity in how vulnerability versus risk is applied, we suggest that instead of being codified or quantified, as it has started to be in some biomedical and public health applications, vulnerability and its remedies should be determined in conjunction with affected communities and in ways that are polyvalent, flexible and nuanced. The concept of vulnerability encapsulates an important precept: we must recognise inequality as undesirable while not attempting to ‘solve’ it in deterministic ways. Rather than becoming fixed into labels, unidirectional causalities or top-down universalising metrics, vulnerability could be used to insist on relational, context-specific understandings of disease and disease risk—in line with contemporary social justice movements that require non-hierarchical and non-universal approaches to problems and solutions.

T1  - Place attachment and perception of climate change as a threat in rural and urban areas
AN  - 2861635037
AB  - Climate change is a global threat to ecosystems and the people that depend on them. However, the perceived threat of climate change may vary spatially. Previous research suggests that inhabitants in rural areas show higher levels of place attachment (associating meaning with a specific place) than urbanites, possibly because rural people depend more directly on their local environment. This can shape perceptions and behaviours, such as enhanced willingness to engage in landscape preservation. Here we ask if it also makes rural people perceive climate change as a greater threat, using a representative sample of 1,071 survey respondents from across the United Kingdom (UK) to provide first-order insights. We found that, whilst indicators of place attachment were indeed more frequent in rural areas, the perceived threat of climate change in the most rural locations was lower. We discuss possible explanations for this pattern (including lower levels of awareness of the anthropogenic causes of climate change, lessened first-hand experiences of climate change impacts due to higher levels of regulating ecosystem services, and higher levels of resilience in rural areas related to a closer relationship with nature), and call for further research to investigate this.

T1  - A systematic review of natural flood management modelling: Approaches, limitations, and potential solutions
AN  - 2847270662
AB  - The Pitt Review of the 2007 summer floods in the UK, published in 2008, commended the potential of natural flood management (NFM) for reducing flood risk. NFM is a nature‐based approach that has since gained substantial interest from both practitioners and academics. The review further highlighted the need for catchment‐based flood management (CBFM) to enhance resilience to flooding and climate change by incorporating NFM and wider nature‐based solutions into hard flood protection systems. Such integrated approaches are considered to be more sustainable and adaptable than the traditional hard‐engineered measures. More recently, the European Commission's European Green Deal also highlighted the need for greater use of nature‐based solutions including NFM for managing flood risk. Whilst there have been many attempts to quantify the effects of NFM through hydraulic and hydrological modelling, there is still no systematic review conducted for these modelling works. This review aims to summarise the current NFM modelling approaches, as well as discussing their key limitations related to data, model methods, and real‐world applications. This paper then goes further to highlight potential solutions to some of these challenges and provides guidance to assist modellers to improve future modelling and data collection process.

T1  - Energy efficiency and CO2 emissions: evidence from the UK universities
AN  - 2833812819
AB  - Understanding how energy efficiency improvement can mitigate CO2 emissions is critical for global climate change policies to ensure environmental sustainability and a low carbon future. Being the catalyst for training future generations, universities can play a leading role in this vision by adopting energy-saving and emissions reduction strategies. Using HESA data, a centralized system of reporting energy use and corresponding emissions, we adopt a two-step system GMM estimation procedure to estimate the effect of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions for 119 UK universities over the period between 2008–2009 and 2018–2019. Results confirm that higher energy efficiency is conducive to lower emissions. However, the less-than-elastic relationship between energy efficiency and emissions implies that energy efficiency improvement alone cannot enable the UK universities to comply with their net-zero objectives unless they increasingly adopt renewable energy sources. Despite this, universities were able to avoid 2.21 gtCO2e emissions over the sample period due to energy efficiency improvements. Our results are robust to alternative specifications.

T1  - Towards near-real-time air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions: lessons learned from multiple estimates during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2838992303
AB  - The 2020 COVID-19 crisis caused an unprecedented drop in anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Given that emissions estimates from official national inventories for the year 2020 were not reported until 2 years later, new and non-traditional datasets to estimate near-real-time emissions became particularly relevant and widely used in international monitoring and modelling activities during the pandemic. This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020 European (the 27 EU member states and the UK) emissions by comparing a selection of such near-real-time emission estimates, with the official inventories that were subsequently reported in 2022 under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Results indicate that annual changes in total 2020 emissions reported by official and near-real-time estimates are fairly in line for most of the chemical species, with NOx and fossil fuel CO2 being reported as the ones that experienced the largest reduction in Europe in all cases. However, large discrepancies arise between the official and non-official datasets when comparing annual results at the sector and country level, indicating that caution should be exercised when estimating changes in emissions using specific near-real-time activity datasets, such as time mobility data derived from smartphones. The main examples of these differences are observed for the manufacturing industry NOx (relative changes ranging between-21.4 % and -5.4 %) and road transport CO2 (relative changes ranging between -29.3 % and -5.6 %) total European emissions. Additionally, significant discrepancies are observed between the quarterly and monthly distribution of emissions drops reported by the various near-real-time inventories, with differences of up to a factor of 1.5 for total NOx during April 2020, when restrictions were at their maximum. For residential combustion, shipping and the public energy industry, results indicate that changes in emissions that occurred between 2019 and 2020 were mainly dominated by non-COVID-19 factors, including meteorology, the implementation of the Global Sulphur Cap and the shutdown of coal-fired power plants as part of national decarbonization efforts, respectively. The potential increase in NMVOC emissions from the intensive use of personal protective equipment such as hand sanitizer gels is considered in a heterogeneous way across countries in officially reported inventories, indicating the need for some countries to base their calculations on more advanced methods. The findings of this study can be used to better understand the uncertainties in near-real-time emissions and how such emissions could be used in the future to provide timely updates to emission datasets that are critical for modelling and monitoring applications.

T1  - Climate change - induced hazards on touristic island beaches: Cyprus, Eastern Mediterranean
AN  - 2836105811
AB  - This contribution presents an assessment at a regional (island) scale of the beach erosion due to storm events under Climate Change. The approach adopted to assess beach erosion at the island scale consisted of three modules. First, the location, dimensions and other attributes of the Cypriot beaches were recorded on the basis of widely-available satellite imagery. Secondly, sea levels and waves were modeled along the coast under different climatic scenarios and dates in the 21st century. Finally, using these projections beach retreat due to the relative mean sea level rise (RSLR) and extreme sea levels (ESLs) was estimated using ensembles of analytical and numerical cross-shore morphodynamic models, respectively. Extreme sea levels (ESLs) were projected to (a) increase by up to 60 % in 2100 from their baseline (2000) levels, and (b) vary along the coast, with the highest ESLs (and corresponding waves) projected for the southern and western coasts. The mostly narrow Cypriot beaches (91 % recorded maximum widths of < 50 m) showed increased exposure to erosion. In 2100, about 47 % and 72 % (based on the median model estimates) of the 241 unprotected Cypriot beaches will be permanently eroded, due to mean sea level rise (SLR), to 50 % of their present maximum width, depending on the scenario. In addition to the long-term erosion due to SLR, severe storm erosion is projected by 2050 even under the RCP4.5 scenario; the 100-year extreme sea level event (ESL100) may overwhelm (at least temporarily) 49 % of the currently unprotected Cypriot beaches without effective adaptation responses, with the most exposed beaches located along the northern coast. As the beach carrying capacity and hedonic value will be severely compromised, effective adaptation policies and technical measures will be urgently required.

T1  - Delivering net zero in the UK: twelve conditions for success
AN  - 2835542647
AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero (NZ) as rapidly as possible is imperative to limiting climate change, and this requires an unprecedented transformation of socio-technical-political systems which govern the energy system. To guide this transition, evidence from a broad range of disciplines is needed, yet rarely are experts able to speak with a coordinated voice on the conditions needed to transform the whole system. Here we draw on novel data from a series of deliberative workshops utilising consensus building techniques with 83 experts and stakeholders from the public, private and third sector, to understand the conditions needed to deliver NZ in the UK. About 12 core conditions are presented: (1) act now to deploy ‘low regret’ solutions on a large scale; (2) to learn from successes and failures, monitor, evaluate and communicate outcomes; (3) clarify governance structures, expectations and responsibilities; (4) upskill and capacity build in the workforce and government; (5) better account for the importance of place and spatial dimensions of the NZ transition; (6) actively engage communities in the changes taking place; (7) realise a just transition; (8) challenge the role of power and vested interests in downplaying and delaying NZ; (9) take an interdisciplinary and whole systems approach; (10) review the research and innovation funding landscape; (11) incentivise collaboration and reward impact; (12) explore competing narratives and transition pathways. Taken together, these conditions can guide decision making and future research agendas in climate change mitigation.

T1  - THE UPPER PERMIAN ZECHSTEIN SUPERGROUP OF NE ENGLAND AND THE ADJACENT SOUTHERN NORTH SEA: A REVIEW OF ITS ROLE IN THE UK'S ENERGY TRANSITION
AN  - 2832218444
AB  - As the United Kingdom reduces its CO2 emissions in order to meet its 2050 net zero greenhouse gas targets, there will be a significant evolution of the UK's energy mix. The reliance on hydrocarbons will decrease while there is predicted to be an increase in low carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear. In order to decarbonise and achieve the net zero emissions targets while concurrently producing enough energy to provide for national energy needs, large‐scale, low carbon energy generation projects need to be developed alongside energy storage facilities to provide flexibility within a low carbon energy supply. Robust CCUS programmes will need be developed in order to capture and store unavoidable carbon dioxide emissions. The subsurface geology of the UK provides opportunities for the development of low carbon energy generation, energy storage and CCS, and the Upper Permian Zechstein Supergroup deposited in eastern England and offshore in the Southern North Sea is a potential host for these new developments. In NE England, salt cavern gas storage sites have been developed in thick Zechstein evaporites since the mid 20th centrury. In this paper we present new isopach maps and well correlation panels which will help to outline optimal locations for the development of additional salt caverns for gas storage. A review of the Zechstein Supergroup indicates that it does not exhibit great potential for the development of CCS, due both to its complex reservoir characteristics and to difficulties with both subsurface imaging and monitoring. However thick Zechstein evaporites could provide an excellent seal for CO2 storage in the underlying Lower Permian Rotliegend Group.

T1  - Temporal variation in spider trophic interactions is explained by the influence of weather on prey communities, web building and prey choice
AN  - 2832218422
AB  - Generalist invertebrate predators are sensitive to weather conditions, but the relationship between their trophic interactions and weather is poorly understood. This study investigates how weather affects the identity and frequency of spider trophic interactions over time, alongside prey community structure, web characteristics and prey choice. Spiders (Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) and their prey were collected from barley fields in Wales, UK, from April to September 2017–2018. The gut contents of 300 spiders were screened using DNA metabarcoding, analysed via multivariate models and compared against prey availability using null models. When linyphiids were collected from webs, the height and area of webs were recorded and compared against weather conditions. Trophic interactions changed over time and with weather conditions, primarily related to concomitant changes in prey communities. Spiders did, however, appear to mitigate the effects of structural changes in prey communities through changing prey preferences according to prevailing weather conditions, possibly facilitated by adaptive web construction. Using these findings, we demonstrate that prey choice data collected under different weather conditions can be used to refine inter‐annual predictions of spider trophic interactions, although prey abundance was secondary to diversity in driving the diet of these spiders. By improving our understanding of the interaction between trophic interactions and weather, we can better predict how ecological networks are likely to change over time in response to variation in weather conditions and, more urgently, global climate change.

T1  - 729 EcoKidzMed: Measuring the carbon emissions of packaging, distribution and waste disposal of liquid and capsule amoxicillin
AN  - 2829243782
AB  - ObjectivesMedicines account for 25% of NHS carbon emissions; switching to ‘low-carbon alternatives’ is required to achieve Net Zero by 2045.1 Many paediatric medicines are prescribed as liquids despite evidence that children can swallow pills from age four.2 Prescribing pills over liquids leads to significant financial savings, yet little research exists comparing the carbon footprint of different medicinal formulations. This study aims to address this. We are limited by lack of information on the carbon emissions of pharmaceutical excipients; therefore we aim to calculate the carbon footprint for packaging, distribution and waste disposal of capsule and liquid formulations of amoxicillin (see figure 1).MethodsWe chose a common clinical problem as a functional unit of comparison: management of group A streptococcal tonsillitis in a 6 year-old child (500mg amoxicillin TDS for 7 days). A pharmaceutical company supplying both liquid and capsule amoxicillin was identified. Individual packaging materials were isolated and weighed. The carbon footprint of producing each material was calculated using UK Government greenhouse gas conversion factors3 and added together to give a total for each formulation of amoxicillin. The carbon footprint of waste disposal for each individual material was calculated in the same way, assuming 100% was domestically recycled. Carbon emissions for distribution were quantified using average distances from continent of origin (Europe) and average emissions for mode of transport (HGV) by weight for each item.ResultsFigure 2 displays total carbon emissions for the packaging, distribution and waste disposal of each item.Carbon emissions (in kg CO2e) for treating group A streptococcal tonsillitis in a 6 year-old child were 0.093 for 250mg capsules, 0.066 for 500mg capsules and 0.307 for 250mg/5ml oral suspension.Abstract 729 Figure 1ConclusionsThe carbon footprint of packaging, distribution and waste disposal of liquid amoxicillin is more than double that of capsules for individually packaged items. The difference in carbon emissions increases to three-fold for a 7-day course of treatment. This is largely explained by increased wastage due to the requirement to dispense whole bottles of liquid formulations as opposed to partial packets of capsules.The accuracy of this study is limited by lack of data on pharmaceutical excipients. We assumed that equivalent doses of active ingredients have a similar carbon footprint, but excipients vary widely between different formulations. Cooperation of the pharmaceutical industry is needed to produce accurate carbon footprints which can inform low-carbon prescribing decisions.ReferencesNHS England. ‘Delivering a ‘Net Zero’ National Health Service’, 2022.Tse, et al. ‘The KidzMed project: teaching children to swallow tablet medication’, 2019.‘UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting’, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2022.

T1  - Viral infections at the animal–human interface—Learning lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
AN  - 2827697936
AB  - This Lilliput explores the current epidemiological and virological arguments for a zoonotic origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the role of bats, pangolins and racoon dogs as viral reservoirs has not yet been proven, a spill-over of a coronavirus infection from animals into humans at the Huanan food market in Wuhan has a much greater plausibility than alternative hypotheses such as a laboratory virus escape, deliberate genetic engineering or introduction by cold chain food products. This Lilliput highlights the dynamic nature of the animal-human interface for viral cross-infections from humans into feral white tail deer or farmed minks (reverse zoonosis). Surveillance of viral infections at the animal-human interface is an urgent task since live animal markets are not the only risks for future viral spill-overs. Climate change will induce animal migration which leads to viral exchanges between animal species that have not met in the past. Environmental change and deforestation will also increase contact between animals and humans. Developing an early warning system for emerging viral infections becomes thus a societal necessity not only for human but also for animal and environmental health (One Health concept). Microbiologists have developed tools ranging from virome analysis in key suspects such as viral reservoirs (bats, wild game animals, bushmeat) and in humans exposed to wild animals, to wastewater analysis to detect known and unknown viruses circulating in the human population and sentinel studies in animal-exposed patients with fever. Criteria need to be developed to assess the virulence and transmissibility of zoonotic viruses. An early virus warning system is costly and will need political lobbying. The accelerating number of viral infections with pandemic potential over the last decades should provide the public pressure to extend pandemic preparedness for the inclusion of early viral alert systems.

T1  - Delivering the Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge: geographical considerations for decarbonisation
AN  - 2826827487
AB  - The UK Government has identified six industrial locations with the highest concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) production to be part of the Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge (IDC) and labelled them 'Industrial Clusters'. To achieve net zero by 2050, heavy industry across the UK must move away from fossil fuels as a power source. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and low-carbon hydrogen in the UK have the prospect of removing upwards of 40MtCO2 per year and producing more than 25GW of hydrogen power. This article introduces the IDC and Industrial Clusters. It then explores the geographical sense of place, place attachment and acceptance considerations that the clusters should be making on their energy transitions as a means to understanding the geography of sustainability transitions.

T1  - A SUM GREATER THAN ITS PARTS
AN  - 2834292896
AB  - In August 2019, I saw Dominique's installation Time to Break Free, inspired by the steampunk art movement, which told the fanciful story of a quilt that was absorbed by a steampunk machine and transmogrified into living characters.

Dominique: I was a chocolate maker and cake baker for 25 years before becoming a fibre artist and quilting teacher.

The model showed that you could change variables such as grind setting or water pressure - and that, for example, if you grind more finely, which gives a higher surface area for the coffee particles, you can extract more espresso.

[...]we don't know the ideal coffee mass, water pressure and particle size, but we can use a system of PDEs to minimize the model's dependence on each parameter.

T1  - Do State-Of-The-Art Atmospheric CO2 Inverse Models Capture Drought Impacts on the European Land Carbon Uptake?
AN  - 2830046881
AB  - The European land carbon uptake has been heavily impacted by several recent severe droughts, yet quantitative estimates of carbon uptake anomalies are uncertain. Atmospheric CO2 inverse models (AIMs) provide observation-based estimates of the large-scale carbon flux dynamics, but how well they capture drought impacts on the terrestrial carbon uptake is poorly known. Here we assessed the capacity of state-of-the-art AIMs in monitoring drought impacts on the European carbon uptake over 2001–2015 using observations of environmental variability and vegetation function and made comparisons with bottom-up estimates of carbon uptake anomalies. We found that global inversions with only limited surface CO2 observations give divergent estimates of drought impacts. Regional inversions assimilating denser CO2 observations over Europe demonstrated some improved consistency, with all inversions capturing a reduction in carbon uptake during the 2012 drought. However, they failed to capture the reduction caused by the 2015 drought. Finally, we found that a set of inversions that assimilated satellite XCO2 or assimilated environmental variables plus surface CO2 observations better captured carbon uptake anomalies induced by both the 2012 and 2015 droughts. In addition, the recent Orbiting Carbon Observatory—2 XCO2 inversions showed good potential in capturing drought impacts, with better performances for larger-scale droughts like the 2018 drought. These results suggest that surface CO2 observations may still be too sparse to fully capture the impact of drought on the carbon cycle at subcontinental scales over Europe, and satellite XCO2 and ancillary environmental data can be used to improve observational constraints in atmospheric inversion systems.

T1  - How will climate change affect the spatial coherence of streamflow and groundwater droughts in Great Britain?
AN  - 2825857367
AB  - How climate change will affect the spatial coherence of droughts is a key question that water managers must answer in order to adopt strategies to mitigate impacts on water resources. Water transfers from regions with excess to those in deficit are fundamental to such strategies, but only possible if both regions are not simultaneously under drought conditions—these relationships could change in a warming world. Here, we use future simulations (under RCP8.5) of streamflow (186 catchments) and groundwater level (41 boreholes) from the Enhanced Future Flows and Groundwater (eFLaG) dataset to analyse the projected change in the spatial coherence of hydrological droughts at a national scale, with Great Britain as an example. Joint and conditional probabilities of two regions being in drought simultaneously are used to characterise the spatial coherence. The results are sensitive to various uncertainties, including the way drought is defined. However, some key findings emerge. In particular, for droughts defined based on current conditions, our results show that the spatial coherence of streamflow droughts for the ‘far future’ (2050–2089) is expected to increase during the summer everywhere in the country. During the winter, however, spatial coherence may only increase in the South-East, where the sharpest rise in winter droughts is likely to occur. The coherence between groundwater and streamflow droughts shows a more mixed picture, dependant on season and region. One important observation is that, in the South-East during the summer, the proportion of streamflow droughts that coincide with groundwater droughts is expected to decrease. These results provide a valuable insight for water managers to help inform their long-term strategy to overcome future impacts of droughts, including the feasibility of inter-region water transfers and conjunctive use (surface and groundwater) schemes. This flexible methodology has the potential to be applied in other parts of the world to help shape strategic regional and national investments to increase resilience to droughts.

T1  - Does medical humanities matter? The challenge of COVID-19
AN  - 2821982575
AB  - Medical humanities has tended first and foremost to be associated with the ways in which the arts and humanities help us to understand health. However, this is not the only or necessarily the primary aim of our field. What the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed above all is what the field of critical medical humanities has insisted on: the deep entanglement of social, cultural, historical life with the biomedical. The pandemic has been a time for reinstating the power of expertise of a particular kind, focusing on epidemiology, scientific modelling of potential outcomes and vaccine development. All of this delivered by science at speed.It has been challenging for medical humanities researchers to find purchase in these debates with insights from our more contemplative, ‘slow research’ approaches. However, as the height of the crisis passes, our field might now be coming into its own. The pandemic, as well as being productive of scientific expertise, also demonstrated clearly the meaning of culture: that it is not a static entity, but is produced and evolves through interaction and relationship. Taking a longer view, we can see the emergence of a certain ‘COVID-19 culture’ characterised by entanglements between expert knowledge, social media, the economy, educational progress, risk to health services and people in their socio-economic, political ethnic and religious/spiritual contexts. It is the role of medical humanities to pay attention to those interactions and to examine how they play out in the human experience and potential impact of the pandemic. However, to survive and grow in significance within the field of healthcare research, we need to engage not just to comment. There is a need for medical humanities scholars to assert our expertise in interdisciplinary research, fully engaged with experts by experience, and to work proactively with funders to demonstrate our value.

T1  - Variability in North Sea wind energy and the potential for prolonged winter wind drought
AN  - 2821349361
AB  - The United Kingdom is committed to substantially increasing offshore wind capacity in its drive to decarbonise electricity production and achieve net zero. If low wind episodes—or ‘wind drought’ events—occur during high energy demand periods, energy security may be threatened without alternative supply. The challenge of managing the variability of wind power will increase into the future as its share in the energy mix increases. This study focuses attention on the North Sea as a centre of current and planned offshore wind resource, and on the winter season, given the occurrence of weather patterns that risk security of supply. We use a large climate model ensemble, providing a dataset an order of magnitude larger than the reanalysis-based observations, to better sample wind drought events. This leads to a more robust estimate of their frequency and persistence and their dynamical teleconnections compared with the observational record. We define week-long wind drought events, based on a 20th percentile threshold in 10 m wind speed, during which wind power is estimated to be around half that in a typical week of winter. Wind drought events of up to two consecutive weeks have been observed, but the model indicates a 1-in-40 chance of three or more continuous weeks of wind drought each winter, with the single most prolonged simulated event lasting 5 weeks. There is a doubling of the likelihood of these prolonged wind drought events during El Niño, indicating that monitoring and predicting the state of the tropical Pacific may be useful in assessing the risk of wind drought events in an upcoming winter.

T1  - EXPLORING CONSUMER PREFERENCES FOR NET-ZERO POLICIES: WILLINGNESS TO PAY AMONG UK CITIZENS FOR NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS UNDER DIFFERENT FUTURE DISCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS
AN  - 2834856037
AB  - Following the UK’s hosting of the United Nations Convention of the Parties Climate Summit in 2021, political targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — “Net-Zero” — have gained momentum. We address the gap in how public preferences are accounted for in climate decision-making by applying Contingent-Valuation techniques which ask people to state their Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for the UK’s 2050 Net-Zero target. Mean WTP is £37.57/household to support Net-Zero (median £11.25), with a present-value of £2.3 billion across UK households. While younger people are more likely to experience the long-term impacts of climate change, older generations are willing to pay more to support it, suggesting that public support for Net-Zero is largely based on “nonuse” benefits, rather than direct “use” benefits to oneself. The COVID-19 epidemic affected WTP bids in a quarter of respondents. Finally, we explore how choice of positive or normative discount rate affects policy conclusions when monetizing consumer preferences.

T1  - Landscape controls on riverine export of dissolved organic carbon from Great Britain
AN  - 2828052064
AB  - The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to ocean via rivers is a significant term in the global C cycle, and has been modified in many areas by human activity. DOC exports from large global rivers are fairly well quantified, but those from smaller river systems, including those draining oceanic regions, are generally under-represented in global syntheses. Given that these regions typically have high runoff and high peat cover, they may exert a disproportionate influence on the global land–ocean DOC export. Here we describe a comprehensive new assessment of the annual riverine DOC export to estuaries across the island of Great Britain (GB), which spans the latitude range 50–60° N with strong spatial gradients of topography, soils, rainfall, land use and population density. DOC yields (export per unit area) were positively related to and best predicted by rainfall, peat extent and forest cover, but relatively insensitive to population density or agricultural development. Based on an empirical relationship with land use and rainfall we estimate that the DOC export from the GB land area to the freshwater-seawater interface was 1.15 Tg C year−1 in 2017. The average yield for GB rivers is 5.04 g C m−2 year−1, higher than most of the world’s major rivers, including those of the humid tropics and Arctic, supporting the conclusion that under-representation of smaller river systems draining peat-rich areas could lead to under-estimation of the global land–ocean DOC export. The main anthropogenic factor influencing the spatial distribution of GB DOC exports appears to be upland conifer plantation forestry, which is estimated to have raised the overall DOC export by 0.168 Tg C year−1. This is equivalent to 15% of the estimated current rate of net CO2 uptake by British forests. With the UK and many other countries seeking to expand plantation forest cover for climate change mitigation, this ‘leak in the ecosystem’ should be incorporated in future assessments of the CO2 sequestration potential of forest planting strategies.

T1  - Rapid, repeatable landscape-scale mapping of tree, hedgerow, and woodland habitats (THaW), using airborne LiDAR and spaceborne SAR data
AN  - 2820272392
AB  - In the UK, tree, hedgerow, and woodland (THaW) habitats are key havens for biodiversity and support many related ecosystem services. The UK is entering a period of agricultural policy realignment with respect to natural capital and climate change, meaning that now is a critical time to evaluate the distribution, resilience, and dynamics of THaW habitats. The fine-grained nature of habitats like hedgerows necessitates mapping of these features at relatively fine spatial resolution—and freely available public archives of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) data at <2 m spatial resolution offer a means of doing so within UK settings. The high cost of LiDAR prohibits use for regular monitoring of THaW change, but space-borne sensors such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR at ca. 10 m resolution) can potentially meet this need once baseline distributions are established. We address two aims in this manuscript—(1) to rapidly quantify THaW across UK landscapes using LiDAR data and (2) to monitor canopy change intra- and inter-annually using SAR data. We show that workflows applied to airborne LiDAR data can deliver THaW baselines at 2 m resolution, with positional accuracy of >90%. It was also possible to combine LiDAR mapping data and Sentinel-1 SAR data to rapidly track canopy change through time (i.e., every 3 months) using, cloud-based processing via Google Earth Engine. The resultant toolkit is also provided as an open-access web app. The results highlight that whilst nearly 90% of the tallest trees (above 15 m) are captured within the National Forest Inventory (NFI) database only 50% of THaW with a canopy height range of 3–15 m are recorded. Current estimates of tree distribution neglect these finer-grained features (i.e., smaller or less contiguous THaW canopies), which we argue will account for a significant proportion of landscape THaW cover.

T1  - Investigating the potential of social media and citizen science data to track changes in species' distributions
AN  - 2820272256
AB  - How to best track species as they rapidly alter their distributions in response to climate change has become a key scientific priority. Information on species distributions is derived from biological records, which tend to be primarily sourced from traditional recording schemes, but increasingly also by citizen science initiatives and social media platforms, with biological recording having become more accessible to the general public. To date, however, our understanding of the respective potential of social media and citizen science to complement the information gathered by traditional recording schemes remains limited, particularly when it comes to tracking species on the move with climate change. To address this gap, we investigated how species occurrence observations vary between different sources and to what extent traditional, citizen science, and social media records are complementary, using the Banded Demoiselle (Calopteryx splendens) in Britain as a case study. Banded Demoiselle occurrences were extracted from citizen science initiatives (iRecord and iNaturalist) and social media platforms (Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter), and compared with traditional records primarily sourced from the British Dragonfly Society. Our results showed that species presence maps differ between record types, with 61% of the citizen science, 58% of the traditional, and 49% of the social media observations being unique to that data type. Banded Demoiselle habitat suitability maps differed most according to traditional and social media projections, with traditional and citizen science being the most consistent. We conclude that (i) social media records provide insights into the Banded Demoiselle distribution and habitat preference that are different from, and complementary to, the insights gathered from traditional recording schemes and citizen science initiatives; (ii) predicted habitat suitability maps that ignore information from social media records can substantially underestimate (by over 3500 km2 in the case of the Banded Demoiselle) potential suitable habitat availability.

T1  - Applying the Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy as a Tool for Flood Resilience
AN  - 2818932261
AB  - Climate change will mean cities are exposed to more frequent short-term shocks such as floods. City-scale resilience is achieved by understanding how these shocks interact with longer-term stressors (e.g., social inequality). The Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) has been developed for this purpose. In this paper, Glasgow (UK) is used as a case study application, to demonstrate how resilience theory can be operationalized through the application of the USAH. Results demonstrate how the USAH can quantify interdependencies between tangible physical entities in the city and intangible outcomes that monitor city stressors, and specifically how these outcomes change in response to a 1:200-year fluvial flood return period in Glasgow. Resilience concepts such as multifunctionality, redundancy and diversity are applied to interpret the results and their implications for longer-term resilience in Glasgow. The findings from the application of the USAH show that the outcome Social equality and equity is influential for longer-term resilience in Glasgow, whilst Reliable communications and mobility is an important outcome for flood resilience.

T1  - The Co-development of Offshore Wind and Hydrogen in the UK – A Case Study of Milford Haven South Wales
AN  - 2818181997
AB  - Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy resources can not only contribute to the decarbonisation of different energy sectors, but also serve as a carrier for long-distance delivery of renewable generation, offering a cost-effective way to exploit the renewables far from electrical grids. To facilitate the co-development of offshore wind and hydrogen, the paper develops a modelling framework to dispatch power and hydrogen flows across dedicated offshore wind hydrogen production systems to meet onshore hydrogen demands while keeping similar state of charge levels between multiple systems. Then the hydrogen supply to shore and the system investments and ongoing costs are discounted to their present values to calculate the levelised cost of hydrogen, which is minimised by the particle swarm optimsiation algorithm to suggest the best capacities of hydrogen system components including converters, desalination devices, electrolysers, compressors and storage assets. The proposed modelling framework is tested based on a case study at Milford Haven South Wales which is evaluated to have massive offshore wind resources in the Celtic Sea and comparable demands for hydrogen by 2040. The optimisation results are presented based on the techno-economic input parameters projected for 2030 and 2050 scenarios and discussed alongside the influences of technology advances on the system optimisation and resulting metrics including the levelised costs of hydrogen, net present values and potential levels of green hydrogen supply to Milford Haven.

T1  - Sustainable Electric Vehicle charging scheme: User requirements in designing energy trading algorithm
AN  - 2811265241
AB  - Promoting Electrical Vehicles (EVs) as a cleaner alternative to traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is an important step towards transformation to a sustainable world. However, usage of grid electricity in charging EVs hinders achieving zero carbon emissions, hence, necessitates developing a renewable energy-based model for EV charging. On the other hand, encouraging renewable energy (RE) usage contributes to United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development. An energy trading algorithm which facilitates trading excess renewable energy generation of households to charge EVs is a key component in such renewable energy-based EV charging model. However, to design an algorithm beneficial for both stakeholders, i.e., EV users and households with solar power systems, user requirements of both stakeholders should be taken into consideration. This paper investigates the user requirements and specifications for an improved energy trading algorithm from both stakeholders’ point of view. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 EV users and 16 household solar users in the United Kingdom (UK) to explore the above. According to the findings of the interviews, both participant categories highlight renewable energy utilisation as a key requirement, whereas EV users highlight non- financial user- experience related requirements such as improving convenience and selection of preferred charging speed and household solar panel users highlight trading with less time and effort as their requirements. Additionally, households also expect higher returns to cover capital costs of solar panel installations. These findings can be used by practitioners from the industry in developing effective energy trading solutions for end users.

T1  - Community resistance and the role of justice in shale gas development in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2808737525
AB  - Global energy policies embracing a transition to unconventional oil and gas development are hallmarks of many developed nations. Among these, the United Kingdom has framed the development of shale gas as one means to transition from high‐carbon fossil‐fuel consumption to low‐carbon alternatives. Yet the introduction of this industry and recent legislation associated with it have not been without controversy. Communities throughout the United Kingdom are engaged in sustained debates concerning climate change, health, the scale of extraction footprints, securitisation, and governance. Places such as Kirby Misperton, the focus of this article, are representative of many villages where questions abound about the role of justice at all stages and scales of governmental decision‐making. Using a legal geographic lens, this article examines narratives among local residents who are actively resisting the arrival of unconventional gas. I consider how the relationships between and among energy transition, policy, and justice have been interpreted by communities and argue for inequity and risk to be addressed in more transparent ways. I contend that highlighting counter‐narratives remains essential if powerful arguments by governments and others are to be negated. Fundamentally, true justice can only prevail when all stakeholders are considered legitimate and their opinions valid.

T1  - The importance of botanic gardens for global change research—New insights into Cambridge's hidden truffle kingdom
AN  - 2805822172
AB  - Social Impact StatementBotanic gardens offer unique opportunities for unravelling responses of plant life to climate change. Despite investigations into their aboveground sphere, the belowground realm is usually neglected. Cambridge University Botanic Garden now illuminates the hidden world of one of the most sought-after culinary delicacies—the Burgundy truffle. The garden's plant diversity, the serendipity of a truffle dog, and our curiosity-driven research agenda reveal insights into 278 truffle fruitbodies that grew symbiotically with an unusually high number of host species. Our study reinforces the power of botanic gardens to disentangle ecosystem processes and emphasizes the proximity of scientific and public interests in truffles.

T1  - Diversified crop rotations and organic amendments as strategies for increasing soil carbon storage and stabilisation in UK arable systems
AN  - 2801822340
AB  - Adaptations in crop rotation with the inclusion of temporary grass-clover leys and organic amendments, have been promoted as effective ways to improve soil carbon (C) sequestration and mitigate climate change in agricultural systems. However, there are still a lot of uncertainties related to (i) the combined effects of different crop rotations and different fertilisation sources e.g., organic amendments, on soil C stocks; and (ii) their potential effect on C stabilisation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different arable crop rotations with varying degrees of diversity in crop type and lengths of grass-clover ley periods and fertilisation sources on soil C stocks and C stabilisation down to 0.60 m soil depth. This was investigated in a long-term factorial field experiment - combining different crop rotation (cereal-intensive conventional vs. diversified legume-intensive organic) with different lengths of grass-clover ley periods (2 vs. 3 years), fertilisation sources (mineral vs. compost), and years (samples taken at the beginning and at the last year of one complete cycle of rotation; 8 years apart) - to explore their individual and interactive effect on soil C stock and C stabilisation at two soil depths (0-0.30 and 0.30-0.60 m). Soil C stabilisation was assessed using a unique combination of three different techniques: physical fractionation for separation of C associated to organic and mineral fractions, thermal analysis combined with differential scanning calorimetry and a quadrupole mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-QMS) for physical-chemical aspects, and pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) for molecular structural information. The findings showed higher soil C stocks under the diversified organic rotation with 3 years of grass-clover ley period at both soil depths, regardless of the fertilisation source or sampling year. However, the organic rotation seemed to deliver stable soil C stocks only in the subsoil layer. Compost fertilisation, in turn, increased topsoil C stocks between the two sample dates under both rotations, and it appears to be stable. These results suggested that combining a diversified organic rotation with 3 years grass-clover ley with compost fertilisation could be one way for agricultural systems to deliver stable soil C sequestration.

T1  - Introduction: Romantic Writing and Ecological Knowledge

AB  - The active volcano on this island offered them the chance to collect more evidence for their evolving hypothesis that all the islands in the South Pacific were of volcanic origin.

[...]they understood that the same volcano fed the vents appearing elsewhere on the island that the European naturalists were attempting to probe with their trowels and thermometer, warning them that these volcanic vents "would take fire, and resemble the volcano, which they called an assoòr.

Critics such as Rob Nixon and Elizabeth DeLoughrey have refocused issues of environmental justice as problems of scale, and Martin Puchner has argued cogently for the urgency of "large-scale thinking about literature and the environment" in a time of climate change.2 Within the field, Seth Reno advocates a reconfiguration of the Romantic period as a phase of the early Anthropocene, echoing other recent critics who have challenged the local chronology associated with Romanticism.3 Several contributors to the present volume have also participated in the rich methodological conversations sparked by the Anthropocene, but the essays gathered here show that local ecological knowledge is still essential for engaging with large regimes of extraction.

Angeletti and Saglia explore an ecocritical application of the geocritical method proposed by Bertrand Westphal, a method also extended to the space of the page by Ruth Knezevich in her recent study of Anna Seward's local poetry.4 Scott Hess offers a methodological reflection on the act of relating oneself to a place, drawing out the implications of Māori traditions of belonging for ecocritical practice, much as scholars in environmental studies assess the potential ecological benefit of recovering indigenous ways of relating to land.

T1  - How well do the UK government’s ‘areas of research interest’ work as boundary objects to facilitate the use of research in policymaking?
AN  - 2809768672
AB  - Articulating the research priorities of government is one mechanism for promoting the production of relevant research to inform policy. This study focuses on the Areas of Research Interest (ARIs) produced and published by government departments in the UK. Through a qualitative study consisting of interviews with 25 researchers, civil servants, intermediaries and research funders, the authors explored the role of ARIs. Using the concept of boundary objects, the paper considers the ways in which ARIs are used and how they are supported by boundary practices and boundary workers, including through engagement opportunities. The paper addresses the following questions: What boundaries do ARIs cross, intended and otherwise? What characteristics of ARIs enable or hinder this boundary-crossing? and What resources, skills, work or conditions are required for this boundary-crossing to work well? We see the ARIs being used as a boundary object across multiple boundaries, with implications for the ways in which the ARIs are crafted and shared. In the application of ARIs in the UK policy context, we see a constant interplay between boundary objects, practices and people all operating within the confines of existing systems and processes. For example, understanding what was meant by a particular ARI sometimes involved ‘decoding’ work as part of the academic-policy engagement process. While ARIs have an important role to play they are no magic bullet. Nor do they tell the whole story of governmental research interests. Optimizing the use of research in policy making requires the galvanisation of a range of mechanisms, including ARIs.

T1  - Integrating existing water and wastewater assets to reduce domestic heating emissions
AN  - 2800549377
AB  - A study was undertaken to explore opportunities for achieving reduced greenhouse gas emissions from UK domestic heating by using existing drinking water and wastewater assets as energy storage and recovery mechanisms, coupled with modest local renewable energy generation. The sensitivity of the solutions to future projections for domestic heating demands and climate change effects was explored. Simulations optimised the available energy supply, potential for storage, heat recovery and heat demand to minimise emissions at a scale that could be adopted in most UK towns. The approach may be able to deliver significant emissions reductions with more limited capital investment than more centralised renewable energy approaches. The results from two UK locations showed that integrated water–energy systems could theoretically reduce emissions by about 50%. Furthermore, the system could satisfy demand for about 70% of the time periods each year. Future scenarios were tested and it was found that the projected annual emissions reduction was similar across all scenarios, suggesting this would be a robust approach.

T1  - ‘All together now’: Facilitators and barriers to engagement in mutual aid during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown
AN  - 2800161268
AB  - Despite undeniable hardship, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic also saw an outpour of community solidarity and mutual aid towards those in need. This study explored why people participated in mutual aid during the pandemic as well as the factors that contributed to continued involvement and/or its decline. We conducted remote interviews with 17 people in South-east England who had been involved in volunteering and local community mutual aid support groups during the first UK lockdown from March to May 2020. Using thematic analysis, we identified two themes: 1) The emergence of social groups and their psychosocial effects, and 2) Enduring connections and barriers to continued participation. Participants often reported an emergent shared identity, preferring the localised nature of these groups and the associated mutual nature of support. They also reported intentions to continue providing such support, should the need arise again, and any barriers to continued involvement in mutual aid were better explained by structural and systemic issues, rather than individual motivational factors.

T1  - Abiotic Stress in Crop Production
AN  - 2799720455
AB  - The vast majority of agricultural land undergoes abiotic stress that can significantly reduce agricultural yields. Understanding the mechanisms of plant defenses against stresses and putting this knowledge into practice is, therefore, an integral part of sustainable agriculture. In this review, we focus on current findings in plant resistance to four cardinal abiotic stressors—drought, heat, salinity, and low temperatures. Apart from the description of the newly discovered mechanisms of signaling and resistance to abiotic stress, this review also focuses on the importance of primary and secondary metabolites, including carbohydrates, amino acids, phenolics, and phytohormones. A meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies concerning the model plant Arabidopsis demonstrates the long-observed phenomenon that abiotic stressors induce different signals and effects at the level of gene expression, but genes whose regulation is similar under most stressors can still be traced. The analysis further reveals the transcriptional modulation of Golgi-targeted proteins in response to heat stress. Our analysis also highlights several genes that are similarly regulated under all stress conditions. These genes support the central role of phytohormones in the abiotic stress response, and the importance of some of these in plant resistance has not yet been studied. Finally, this review provides information about the response to abiotic stress in major European crop plants—wheat, sugar beet, maize, potatoes, barley, sunflowers, grapes, rapeseed, tomatoes, and apples.

T1  - A review of planting principles to identify the right place for the right tree for ‘net zero plus’ woodlands: Applying a place-based natural capital framework for sustainable, efficient and equitable (SEE) decisions
AN  - 2793864840
AB  - We outline the principles of the natural capital approach to decision making and apply these to the contemporary challenge of very significantly expanding woodlands as contribution to attaining net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.Drawing on the case of the UK, we argue that a single focus upon carbon storage alone is likely to overlook the other ‘net zero plus’ benefits which woodlands can deliver.A review of the literature considers the wide variety of potential benefits which woodlands can provide, together with costs such as foregone alternative land uses.We argue that decision making must consider all of these potential benefits and costs for the right locations to be planted with the right trees.The paper closes by reviewing the decision support systems necessary to incorporate this information into policy and decision making.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

T1  - Research-informed teaching for assessing BIM courses during COVID-19 and beyond
AN  - 2779371865
AB  - PurposeIn the COVID-19 era, where blended learning is gaining popularity, research-informed teaching could be one of the alternatives or options to assess students' progress in Higher Education institutions. In the past, educators have assessed students' research skills gained from research-informed teaching through coursework components or assignments. However, whether the assignments can be converted into peer-reviewed output acceptable in a reputable journal or conference has hardly been investigated. This study explores how research-informed teaching has been rolled out in undergraduate/postgraduate BIM related modules/programmes in the School of the Built Environment, Oxford Brookes University and which has culminated in high quality published outputs.Design/methodology/approachThe method used is purely qualitative in-depth interviews, where students who have published were tracked and invited to share their experiences. In total, nine former students of the 12 invited, participated in the interviews. Inductive content analysis, a suitable qualitative data analysis technique was used in analysing the feedback from the interviews.FindingsThe main finding is that research-informed teaching can be done in a technical and complex BIM discipline and students' coursework components or assignments can further be converted into published outputs.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this study was that the sample was small. That notwithstanding, it has provided valuable insights into the understanding of student's ability to undertake research while studying and experiences of how educators can deliver research-informed teaching to students in Higher Education institutions.Originality/valueThe study adds to the existing body of literature about undergraduate and postgraduate research-informed teaching and goes further to provide strong evidence through published outputs thereby confirming that students at both levels can indeed conduct and publish peer-reviewed research articles while undertaking their studies.

T1  - Corporate sustainability disclosure on social media and its difference from sustainability reports:Evidence from the energy sector
AN  - 2847015527
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the sustainability information that energy firms disclose on social media and the connection between this information and that disclosed in traditional sustainability reports. Based on stakeholder theory, we use a sample of Chinese listed energy firms in 2020 and refer to GRI G4 guidelines to conduct content analysis on their 17,451 tweets from the WeChat platform and 53 sustainability reports. The analysis results show the following: (1) both the sustainability disclosures of Chinese energy firms on social media and sustainability reports focus on investor and employee dimensions. Among them, the average proportion of investor dimension disclosure to total disclosure is 31.92% and 27.22% on social media and sustainability reports, respectively, and the average proportion of employee dimension disclosure is 35.19% and 17.92%, respectively. However, the two channels show a large difference in the environmental and governmental dimensions. The average proportion of environmental disclosure in sustainability reports is 13.44%, while on social media it is only 2.01%. Governmental disclosure in sustainability reports is 8.24% and as high as 20.43% on social media. (2) Chinese energy firms prefer to provide supplementary information on social media. For example, using the investor dimension as an example, the average proportion of non-GRI information on social media is 74.20%, while that of the sustainability report is only 39.30%.

T1  - A qualitative assessment of the impact of smart homes and environmentally beneficial technologies on the UK 2050 net-zero carbon emission target
AN  - 2776881145
AB  - PurposeThere are 29 million homes in the UK, accounting for 14% of the UK's energy consumption. This is given that UK has one of the highest water and energy demands in Europe which needs to be addressed according to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). Smart homes technology holds a current perception that it is principally used by “tech-savvy” users with larger budgets. However, smart home technology can be used to control water, heat and energy in the entire house. This paper investigates how smart home technology could be effectively utilised to aid the UK government in meeting climate change targets and to mitigate the environmental impact of a home in use towards reducing carbon emissions.Design/methodology/approachBoth primary and secondary data were sought to gain insight into the research problem. An epistemological approach to this research is to use interpretivism to analyse data gathered via a semi-structured survey. Two groups of participants were approached: (1) professionals who are deemed knowledgeable about smart home development and implementation and (2) users of smart home technology. A variety of open-ended questions were formulated, allowing participants to elaborate by exploring issues and providing detailed qualitative responses based on their experience in this area which were interpreted quantitatively for clearer analysis.FindingsWith fossil fuel reserves depleting, there is an urgency for renewable, low carbon energy sources to reduce the 5 tonnes annual carbon emissions from a UK household. This requires a multi-faceted and a multimethod approach, relying on the involvement of both the general public and the government in order to be effective. By advancing energy grids to make them more efficient and reliable, concomitant necessitates a drastic change in the way of life and philosophy of homeowners when contemplating a reduction of carbon emissions. If both parties are able to do so, the UK is more likely to reach its 2050 net-zero carbon goal. The presence of a smart meter within the household is equally pivotal. It has a positive effect of reducing the amount of carbon emissions and hence more need to be installed.Research limitations/implicationsFurther research is needed using a larger study sample to achieve more accurate and acceptable generalisations about any future course of action. Further investigation on the specifics of smart technology within the UK household is also needed to reduce the energy consumption in order to meet net-zero carbon 2050 targets due to failures of legislation.Practical implicationsFor smart homes manufacturers and suppliers, more emphasis should be placed to enhance compatibility and interoperability of appliances and devices using different platform and creating more user's friendly manuals supported by step-by-step visual to support homeowners in the light of the wealth of knowledge base generated over the past few years. For homeowners, more emphasis should be placed on creating online knowledge management platform easily accessible which provide virtual support and technical advice to home owners to deal with any operational and technical issues or IT glitches. Developing technical design online platform for built environment professionals on incorporating smart sensors and environmentally beneficial technology during early design and construction stages towards achieving low to zero carbon homes.Originality/valueThis paper bridges a significant gap in the body of knowledge in term of its scope, theoretical validity and practical applicability, highlighting the impact of using smart home technology on the environment. It provides an insight into how the UK government could utilise smart home technology in order to reduce its carbon emission by identifying the potential link between using smart home technology and environmental sustainability in tackling and mitigating climate change. The findings can be applied to other building types and has the potential to employ aspects of smart home technology in order to manage energy and water usage including but not limited to healthcare, commercial and industrial buildings.

T1  - The evolution of UK sea-level projections
AN  - 2797089318
AB  - The methods used to generate process-based global and local mean sea-level projections have evolved substantially over the last fifteen years, including improved process understanding, advances in ice-sheet modelling, the use of emulators and further development of high-end scenarios. During this time, two sets of UK national sea-level projections have been generated as part of the UK Climate Projections in 2009 (UKCP09; Lowe et al 2009) and in 2018 (UKCP18; Palmer et al 2018b). UKCP18 presented local mean sea-level projections for the UK coastline for the 21st century rooted in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and in methods used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), with an emulator-based methodology to provide extended projections to 2300 (Palmer et al 2018a; 2020). We compare UKCP18 global and local mean sea-level projections with those presented in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, IPCC ). We find the likely range projections (characterising the central two-thirds of the distribution) are broadly similar at 2150 to within 0.1 m, except at Edinburgh, where the maximum difference is 0.22 m under medium emissions. Differences arise due to higher contributions from sterodynamic processes and the Antarctic ice sheet, and higher or lower vertical land movement, in AR6 compared to UKCP18. We also compare high-end sea-level rise estimates, presented in AR6 and UKCP09, finding reasonable global and UK local agreement over the 21st century. We explore future paths for UK sea-level science considering both user needs for information and developments in modelling capability. Future UK sea-level projections would benefit from updated high-end sea-level rise scenarios which extend beyond 2100 and continued efforts to build understanding of observed sea-level change drivers. Alongside close collaboration with user groups this would enhance the utility of local sea-level projections by UK coastal practitioners and decision-makers.

T1  - Dating springlines from hydrogeological and archaeological evidence
AN  - 2792157057
AB  - The relationship between prehistoric populations and water is often poorly understood, partly as a function of historical reliance on qualitative and fragmentary datasets in many regions. Here, we adopt a quantitative approach to analyze a specific aspect of the relationship between prehistoric populations and water for the Cotswold Hills, southwest UK; an area of documented hydrogeological change and extensive Neolithic (ca. 5.5 ka) activity. Using a database of all known Neolithic monuments, we interrogate the significance of water to their habitation. By marshaling a large dataset of recent (ca. 100 years) changes in the discharge and elevation of 259 springs, we establish a striking negative relationship between present-day spring discharge and annual elevation change. We then formulate an inverse problem to predict spring elevations in Neolithic times. Spring elevations are predicted to be closer to, and higher than, Neolithic-dated sites relative to the location of modern springs. These results emphasize a utilitarian and/or reverential link between water and prehistoric populations. Our approach of reconciling markedly different datasets and timescales can easily be adapted to other regions. While groundwater had behaved reasonably predictably since Neolithic times, recent human activity is (and will continue to be) far more significant in influencing groundwater behavior.

T1  - Use of electrical resistivity tomography to reveal the shallow freshwater–saline interface in The Fens coastal groundwater, eastern England (UK)

AN  - 2789885121
AB  - The Fens is a region that contributes 11% of the agri-food economy from just 4% of the agricultural land covering England (UK). This region is vulnerable to soil salinisation from sea-level rise with estimated 100-year flood events projected to be observed up to every 2 years by 2100. Seawater intrusion and upwelling of saline groundwater can provide an additional pathway; however, the area’s groundwater has not been assessed and the risk is unknown. This study used data from the British Geological Survey’s stratigraphic core archive to produce the first stratigraphic map of the loosely consolidated Holocene deposits in the South Holland–Holbeach Marsh region. There is a sandy unconfined aquifer towards the coast, a semiconfined central region with a silty cap and a clay confining cap in the north region. Electrical resistivity tomography data indicate water level depths of 0.58 ± 0.37 m above mean sea level (msl) in February 2021 and 0.01 ± 0.72 m msl in August 2021. The saline–freshwater boundary was at 1.70 ± 0.82 m msl in February 2021, deepening to 2.00 ± 1.02 m msl in August 2021, but the only evidence of seasonal fluctuation was within 10 km of the coast. A potential, but unverified, freshwater lens up to 3.25 m thick may exist beneath the surface. These results suggest that freshwater–saline interface fluctuations may primarily be driven by surface hydrology and would be vulnerable to climate-change-induced future variations in factors that affect surface water.Alternate abstract:RésuméLes Fens est. une région qui contribue pour 11% à l’économie agro-alimentaire, à partir de seulement 4% des terres agricoles couvrant l’Angleterre (Royaume Uni). Cette région est. exposée à une salinisation des sols due à la remontée du niveau de la mer, avec des inondations centennales qui devraient être observées jusqu’à tous les 2 ans d’ici à 2100. L’intrusion de l’eau de mer et la remontée d’eaux souterraines salées peuvent offrir un cheminement supplémentaire, mais les eaux souterraines de la région n’ont pas été évaluées et ce risque est. inconnu. La présente étude a utilisé les données provenant des archives de base stratigraphiques du Service Géologique de Grande Bretagne pour produire la première carte stratigraphique des dépôts holocènes faiblement consolidés de la région sud du Holland-Holbeach Marsh. Il y a un aquifère libre sableux près de la côte, une région centrale semi-captive sous couverture silteuse et un recouvrement argileux confinant dans la région nord. Les données issues d’une tomographie de résistivité électrique indiquent des profondeurs du niveau de l’eau de 0.58 ± 0.37 m au-dessus du niveau moyen de la mer (nmm) en février 2021 et de 0.01 ± 0.72 m nmm en août 2021. La limite eau-salée–eau douce était à 1.70 ± 0.82 m nmm en Février 2021, s’approfondissant à 2.00 ± 1.02 m nmm en Août 2021, mais la seule preuve de fluctuations saisonnières était à moins de 10 km de la côte. Une lentille d’eau douce potentielle, mais non vérifiée, atteignant 3.25 m d’épaisseur, peut exister en-dessous de la surface. Ces résultats suggèrent que les fluctuations de l’interface eau douce–eau salée peuvent être contrôlées principalement par l’hydrologie de surface et seraient sensibles aux variations futures, induites par le changement climatique, des facteurs qui impactent l’eau de surface.Alternate abstract:ResumenLos Fens son una región que aporta el 11% de la economía agroalimentaria a partir de sólo el 4% de las tierras agrícolas que cubren Inglaterra (Reino Unido). Esta región es vulnerable a la salinización del suelo debido a la elevación del nivel del mar, ya que se prevé que las inundaciones de 100 años se produzcan hasta cada dos años de aquí a 2100. La intrusión del agua del mar y el afloramiento de aguas subterráneas salinas pueden constituir una fuente adicional, pero las aguas subterráneas de la zona no han sido evaluadas y se desconoce el riesgo. Este estudio utilizó datos del archivo de columnas estratigráficas del Servicio Geológico Británico para elaborar el primer mapa del Holoceno poco consolidado en la región de South Holland-Holbeach Marsh. Existe un acuífero arenoso no confinado hacia la costa, una región central semiconfinada con una cubierta de limos y una capa confinada por arcilla en la región norte. Los datos de tomografía de resistividad eléctrica indican profundidades de nivel de agua de 0.58 ± 0.37 m sobre el nivel medio del mar (msl) en febrero de 2021 y 0.01 ± 0.72 m msl en agosto de 2021. El límite entre el agua salada y el agua dulce se encuentra a 1.70 ± 0.82 m sobre el nivel del mar en febrero de 2021, y se profundiza hasta 2.00 ± 1.02 m sobre el nivel del mar en agosto de 2021, pero la única evidencia de fluctuación estacional se encuentra a 10 km de la costa. Bajo la superficie puede existir una lente de agua dulce de hasta 3.25 m de espesor, aunque no se ha verificado. Estos resultados sugieren que las fluctuaciones de la interfaz agua dulce–salada pueden ser provocadas principalmente por la hidrología de la superficie y serían vulnerables a las variaciones futuras inducidas por el cambio climático en los factores que afectan al agua superficial.Alternate abstract:摘要Fens仅占英格兰(英国)农业土地的4%，农业用品经济却占11%。该地区容易受到海平面上升影响产生土壤盐碱化问题，估计到2100年预计每2年观察到100年一遇的洪水事件。海水入侵和盐水的升锥可以提供额外的途径，但是该地区地下水未能开展评估工作，而且风险尚不清楚。 这项研究使用了英国地质调查局的地层岩心档案馆中的数据，以制作首个South Holland和Holbeach Marsh地区松散固结的全新世沉积物地层图。海岸有一个砂质承压含水层，北部地区有粉质盖层和粘土承压盖层的半承压中央区域。 电阻层析成像数据表明，2021年2月的水位深度在平均海平面(MSL)以上0.58 ± 0.37 m，在2021年8月的水位深度为0.01 ± 0.72 m msl。 咸淡水界面在2021年2月是1.70 ± 0.82 m msl，2021年8月至2.00 ± 1.02 m msl，但唯一的季节性波动证据在海岸10公里以内。 潜力(但未验证)可能存在于表面下面的3.25 m厚的淡水透镜体。 这些结果表明，淡水 – 咸水界面的波动可能主要由地表水文驱动，并且很容易受到气候变化引起的未来地表水因素的变化。Alternate abstract:ResumoThe Fens é uma região que contribui com 11% da economia agroalimentar de apenas 4% das terras agrícolas que cobrem a Inglaterra (Reino Unido).

Esses resultados sugerem que as flutuações da interface água doce-salina podem ser causadas principalmente pela hidrologia de superfície e seriam vulneráveis a variações futuras induzidas pelas mudanças climáticas em fatores que afetam as águas superficiais.

T1  - Leading the work on neglected tropical diseases
AN  - 2778909598
AB  - On Jan 26, 2023, the London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research (LCNTDR) celebrated its 10th anniversary with a research event at the Natural History Museum, London, UK.

Founded in 2013 with an original partnership between Imperial College London, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Natural History Museum, and the Royal Veterinary College, the LCNTDR is an innovative research collaboration that brings together leading experts to conduct cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral research to build the evidence base around the design, implementation, and evaluation of neglected tropical disease (NTD) programmes.

Since its inauguration, the Centre has grown to include thirteen research institutions from London and low-income and middle-income countries where NTDs are endemic, and has contributed to a broad range of major research projects, such as those that test the feasibility of interrupting the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis (the Geshiyaro Project and DeWorm3).

De Leo spoke about the impact of climate change on NTD programmes, and in particular, the effect of increased temperatures on the lifecycles of NTD transmitting insects, including mosquitoes and ticks, which will benefit from anthropogenic changes and will increase their geographical range and abundance as temperatures increase.

T1  - Initial ecological change in plant and arthropod community composition after wildfires in designated areas of upland peatlands
AN  - 2779989574
AB  - Wildfires are an increasing concern due to rising temperatures and incidence of droughts associated with changing climate, poor land management, and direct human interference. Most studies of the impact of fire on temperate heathland and bog examined the consequences of controlled or prescribed burning. Less is known about the impacts of uncontrolled wildfires on sites designated for their conservation value. We examined the initial impact and short-term trajectory (3.5 years) of cool temperate peatland plant and arthropod communities on designated upland sites in Northern Ireland following wildfires, that is, unplanned with respect to where and when they occur, severity, and duration. These near simultaneous wildfires were often due to a failure to control prescribed burns. Wildfires were associated with a loss of blanket bog and heath indicator species. Broad vegetation groups showed initial recovery characterized by a decrease in bare ground and increasing cover of shrub species and bryophytes. However, at a species level, Sphagnum spp and bryophyte communities, which are central to peatland ecosystem functioning, showed no sign of recovery to prefire composition. Rather, bryophyte communities became more divergent over the course of the study and were mainly characterized by increased abundance of the alien pioneer acrocarp Campylopus introflexus. Similarly, composition of arthropod communities (ground beetles and spiders) differed between burnt and unburnt areas and showed no evidence of a return to species composition in unburnt areas. The nationally rare beetle Carabus nitens was more common in the aftermath of wildfire. Synthesis. Whilst, long-term recovery was not investigated, these short-term changes suggest enduring detrimental impacts on the distinctive communities associated with peatlands, primarily through the loss of Sphagnum spp., affecting ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water and soil retention. It may not be possible to restore exact prefire species composition of plant and animal communities. We suggest a precautionary approach involving management of upland vegetation, public education, and vigilance, to prevent further wildfires and protect these key upland habitats.

T1  - Perception spillover from fracking onto public perceptions of novel energy technologies
AN  - 2779665045
AB  - Public opposition to new energy technology can harm the chances of successful deployment. Less is known about knock-on effects on the wider energy system, including whether such opposition impacts public perceptions of other technologies. Here we present a mixed-methods study into ‘perception spillover’, examining whether the controversy over fracking for oil and gas affects public attitudes to two novel low-carbon energy technologies: deep ‘enhanced’ geothermal systems and ‘green’ hydrogen. We argue that perception spillover is multi-faceted, and we conceptualize and test spontaneous, prompted and primed forms, examining how and why particular types occur. Using a nationally representative UK survey and two focus groups, we show that perception spillover from fracking could lead to widespread negative perceptions of deep geothermal energy, influencing the conditions that deep geothermal would be expected to meet. Conversely, a minority of participants expressed more positive perceptions of green hydrogen because they deemed it dissimilar to fracking.Public support or opposition plays an important role in the deployment of new energy technologies. This study explores how attitudes towards fracking in the United Kingdom can influence perceptions of geothermal systems and hydrogen, testing spontaneous, prompted and primed forms of the spillover effect.

T1  - Hybrid photovoltaic-liquid air energy storage system for deep decarbonization
AN  - 2774672920
AB  - Nowadays most photovoltaic (PV) plants usually use battery energy storage technology to smooth fluctuant power, but batteries have the drawbacks of a short lifetime and environmental pollution. The existing renewable power networks have serious problems with decarbonizing electricity on the end-user side. This paper investigates a new hybrid photovoltaic-liquid air energy storage (PV-LAES) system to provide solutions for the low-carbon transition for future power and energy networks. In this article, a local PV power plant cooperates with its maximum power point tracking (MPPT)-based boost converter, to generate low-carbon electricity with some uncertain fluctuations. Then a zero-emission-air-based LAES unit is used to absorb the surplus power from the PV plant, and also compensate power for the local load with inadequate power level. This makes the new system save a large proportion of power from main grids, which can also indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For the MW-class PV-LAES case, results show that the surplus renewable electricity (6.73 MWh) generates 27.12 tons of liquid air for energy backups during the day time, and then the LAES unit has a round-trip efficiency of 47.4% that can discharge a flexible power compensation to the load in the night. Accordingly, the grid power demand reduces significantly from 12.78 to 3.33 MWh in a day. In this way, the annual power savings is estimated to be 3449.25 MWh, and the corresponding carbon emission can be reduced by 2607.63 tons. Regarding the economic performance, the PV-LAES system presents a dynamic payback period of 9.33 years and an accumulated life-cycle net profit of $2,260,011. Overall, the proposed PV-LAES scheme is economically feasible from a life-cycle perspective, and can potentially realize flexible energy interaction with local renewables to achieve an integrated low-carbon power generation and storage system.

T1  - Space temperature policy towards net-zero: recommendations from a systematic review of UK HEI heating policies
AN  - 2773993483
AB  - The UK government has committed to reducing its carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are high energy users, with the largest proportion of their energy demand for space heating; an area still dominated by carbon-intensive fuels. This research addresses the UK HEI space temperature policy landscape, making direct links between space temperature policy and carbon management, advocating the development of evidence-based policies as a critical tool for reducing carbon emissions within the sector. Sixty-six space temperature policies were reviewed, and five experienced energy managers were interviewed to understand the range, development and use of space temperature policies in UK HEIs. The research identified a lack of consistency across these policies, leading to missed opportunities for making energy and carbon savings. The research highlights gaps in the available data and literature needed to connect policy to its effectiveness, and identifies the use of policy as a defensive tool against complaints rather than an active driver of energy reduction. A series of recommendations are proposed for national and institutional policymakers, suggesting areas for improvement and future research to facilitate effective development and practice in space temperature policy towards net-zero.

T1  - Do green innovation and financial globalization contribute to the ecological sustainability and energy transition in the United Kingdom? Policy insights from a bootstrap rolling window approach
AN  - 2771302795
AB  - Environmental sustainability and energy transition, especially the renewable energy transition, have become critical concerns of nations throughout the world in recent decades. The sustainable and eco‐friendly technologies have led to more sustainable methodologies, substantial stewardship of our natural resources, and the conversion to renewable energy sources, all of which have been demonstrated to benefit the environment significantly. However, prior studies have overlooked the ecological sustainability and energy transition effects of green technology innovation. Therefore, this study endeavored to investigate the role of green innovation (lnGRN) and financial globalization (lnFIG) on the sustainability of the environment (lnEFT) and energy transition (lnENT) in the United Kingdom using quarterly data for the period from 1995 to 2020. The study applied the time‐varying (bootstrapping) rolling window technique, which can retrieve casual associations among variables at different periods of sub‐samples. Besides this, the method is advantageous for addressing the non‐consistency of parameters and eliminating the pre‐test distortion. The novel Bootstrap Rolling‐Window full‐sample causality technique results demonstrate that lnGRN and lnFIG have unidirectional causality toward lnEFT and lnENT. Furthermore, the bootstrap rolling‐window subsamples in the final stage indicate that lnGRN and lnFIG mitigate lnEFT, whereas lnGRN and lnGDP enhance energy transition. On the other hand, lnGDP and lnETX contribute to environmental deterioration, while lnFIG hinders the energy transition. Several important policy implications are derived from the results to encourage financial globalization, green innovation technologies, renewable energy resources consumption, and environmental taxes.

T1  - Challenging the new blue deal by embedding interactions with the non-humans in the offshore renewable energy development
AN  - 2777095208
AB  - This paper is challenging the new blue deal outlining the need for a change in the expectative. OWF are not only a climate-friendly way of producing electricity but also a shifting paradigm unique opportunity, acknowledging the increasing presence of anthropogenic infrastructure in the marine environment and seeing them as the place for re-creating relations with non-humans and work with them. We give some ideas that could ground a research program pairing both positive and negative aspects of OWF and study the conditions of realization of mutual beneficial relationship coming from the “mosaic of open-ended assemblages of entangled ways of life”.

T1  - Life Cycle Analysis of Hydrogen Powered Marine Vessels—Case Ship Comparison Study with Conventional Power System
AN  - 2862721783
AB  - The latest International Maritime Organization strategies aim to reduce 70% of the CO2 emissions and 50% of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from maritime activities by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. The EU has set up goals to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990, and achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The UK aims to achieve more than 68% GHG emission reduction by 2030 and net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. There are many solutions under development to tackle the challenge of meeting the latest decarbonization strategies from the IMO, EU, and UK, among which are hydrogen powered marine vessels. This paper presents a life cycle analysis study for hydrogen fuelled vessels by evaluating their performance in terms of environmental friendliness and economic feasibility. The LCA study will consider the gas emissions and costs during the life stages of the ships, including the construction, operation, maintenance, and recycling phases of the selected vessels. The results of the comparisons with the conventional version of the ships (driven by diesel generators) demonstrate the benefits of using hydrogen for marine transportation: over 80% emission reduction and around 60% life cycle cost savings. A sensitivity analysis shows that the prices of fuels and carbon credits can affect the life cycle cost, and recommendations for low H2 price and high carbon credit in the future are provided to attract the industry to adopt the new fuel.

T1  - Contemporary Global Coastal Management Strategies and Coastal Infrastructure and Their Application in Ghana: A Systematic Literature Review
AN  - 2862719857
AB  - Systematic literature reviews provide the foundation for evidence-based research in a particular field of study. In this regard, the systematic review of the relationship between coastal management strategies and coastal infrastructure typologies provides an opportunity to benchmark local coastal adaptation policies against contemporary global practices, technologies, and sustainability. However, systematic reviews of coastal infrastructure in Ghana and West Africa at large are limited. To close this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of the global implementation of coastal management strategies and coastal infrastructure and provided a synopsis of coastal management in Ghana. To achieve this, we searched the Scopus Database for literature on coastal management approaches and infrastructure typologies. Forty-eight peer-reviewed publications met the inclusion criteria for full-text analysis. The results indicate a significant global shift from purely grey infrastructure toward integrating green and grey infrastructure. However, despite contemporary global advances, coastal infrastructure in developing contexts—particularly in Ghana—remains mostly static, using reactive, hold the line strategies, and grey infrastructure. As sea-level rise continues to intensify coastal hazards globally, increasing the demand for coastal protection, researching coastal management policies and coastal infrastructure is essential to support the hybridization of grey and green infrastructure and encourage transitions to adaptive coastal management instead of continuous coastal hardening using grey infrastructure.

T1  - The Long-Term Course of the Annual Total Sunshine Duration in Europe and Changes in the Phases of the Thermohaline Circulation in the North Atlantic (1901–2018)
AN  - 2861897219
AB  - The current study was based on sunshine duration data from 13 European stations during 1901–2018. It was found that the variability in the annual total sunshine duration (SD) over Europe is related to the variability in the component of the surface thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic (NA THC). Positive NA THC phases (the condition of the ‘warm’ North Atlantic) correspond to the periods of increased SD (brightening), while negative phases correspond to the periods of decreased SD (dimming). These relationships remain stable and statistically significant. The mechanism of these relationships is based on the influence of weakened or enhanced heat flow from the ocean to the atmosphere on the course of the mid-tropospheric circulation processes. In periods of positive thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic (NA THC) phases, the share of long waves (macrotype W according to the Wangengejm–Girs classification) increases, with the occurrence of which the frequency of anticyclonic weather over Europe increases, whereas in the periods of negative NA THC phases, the share of shorter waves (macrotypes E and C) increases, with the occurrence of which the frequency of cyclonic (frontal) weather over Europe increases. It is characterised by increased layer cloud cover, limiting the SD. Thus, along with changes in the thermal condition of the North Atlantic, the structure of cloud cover over Europe changes and becomes a factor regulating long-term changes in the annual total SD.

T1  - Reconceptualising Preservice Teachers’ Subject Knowledge in Climate Change and Sustainability Education: A Framework for Initial Teacher Education from England, UK
AN  - 2857446308
AB  - Climate Change and Sustainability Education (CCSE) has been gaining prominence with the imminent climate emergency humanity is facing. This paper draws upon a conceptual framework created to support the development of preservice teachers’ subject knowledge of CCSE whilst undertaking Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programs in England. The core aims and learning outcomes within the framework, namely knowledge; attitudes, values and behaviours; and competences and capabilities, are defined to illustrate what subject knowledge looks like, in this area, for preservice teachers in England. This paper highlights data gathered from 71 preservice teachers via an initial presurvey from three ITE institutions across England. The data were gathered from Early Years and Primary and Secondary phase trainees across both postgraduate and undergraduate programmes. The presurvey captured a range of qualitative and quantitative responses from preservice teachers to showcase priority areas, from their perspective, in the teaching of CCSE. The responses were coded and then themed according to the three aims and learning outcomes of the framework (knowledge; attitudes, values and behaviours; and competences and capabilities) to understand preservice teachers’ views on CCSE at the start of their courses. The findings suggest that preservice teachers lack key subject knowledge in CCSE to teach it effectively in schools. Hence, this paper recommends further work needs to be carried out to embed CCSE work in ITE courses across England. It is further suggested that the CCSE framework highlighted in this paper can act as a key national document to support ITE institutions to conceptualise the teaching and learning of CCSE across their ITE programmes.

T1  - Context Analysis for Transformative Change in the Ceramic Industry
AN  - 2857444047
AB  - Foundation industries are under increasing pressure to transform for sustainable development. Ceramics play a key role within foundation industries as a necessary material for building manufacturing facilities. Therefore, transforming the ceramic industry could support changes across other foundation industries as well, making it one of the most important industries to transform. Given the limited finances, staff time, and other resources to support transformative change, this study aims to identify a set of key intervention points to enable transformative change in the ceramic industry in the United Kingdom. A desk-based study, reviewing written industry, government, and scientific materials available in the public domain, was carried out to identify initial key intervention points for transformative change. The PESTLE approach was used to analyse macro factors in political, environmental, social, technological, legal, and economic domains in order to understand how the context enables or constrains change in the ceramic industry. A SWOT analysis was conducted to further consolidate the findings. Our analysis detected over 50 transformative change drivers and barriers and showed that decarbonisation and energy-saving strategies were the main drivers for transforming the UK ceramic industry. On the other hand, foreign government policy and legislation, trade barriers, skills shortages, and costly alternative energy sources were among the major barriers.

T1  - Plant Breeding to Mitigate Climate Change—Present Status and Opportunities with an Assessment of Winter Wheat Cultivation in Northern Europe as an Example
AN  - 2857443508
AB  - Crop yield has been a major target of plant breeding, although resistance and quality have also been important. The current climate change is calling for breeding actions to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The present review focuses on opportunities from plant breeding to mitigate climate change while simultaneously securing yield and food requirements, as exemplified by winter wheat cultivation in Northern Europe. Therefore, we review the history of traditional plant breeding, the impact of climate change on crops and implications for plant breeding, opportunities to use plant breeding as a tool to mitigate climate change, and then we assess the estimated mitigation effects from plant breeding and discuss their impact on climate effects. Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) was indicated as the character with the highest potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, with positive effects also from increased straw length and stubble heights, while increased total biomass yield (root or above-ground) showed less effect. In addition to contributing to climate change mitigation, NUpE might increase profitability for growers and decrease nitrogen leakage from agricultural fields. An increase in NUpE by 15% through plant breeding has the potential to result in reduced GHG emissions corresponding to 30% of the fossil fuel use in agriculture in Sweden.

T1  - Evidence Synthesis towards a Holistic Landscape Decision Framework: Insight from the Landscape Decisions Programme
AN  - 2857107438
AB  - The development of a decision framework for landscape governance and management has become one of the prioritised policy instruments for actualising policy objectives related to agri-food systems, biodiversity conservation, nature restoration, environmental management, climate change mitigation and adaptation, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and the transition to renewable energy supplies. However, the landscape lens in policy making is challenging because of the diverse landscape archetypes, environmental problems, and diverging policy targets that it must address. This highlights the importance of having a robust, evidence-based landscape decision framework. To address this issue, this study undertook a transdisciplinary synthesis of research outputs from the Landscape Decisions Programme (LDP). This study compiles and synthesises outputs from the LDP projects in the context of the relevant literature to develop an understanding of the relationships among the emerging evidence with respect to decision making for sustainable and multifunctional landscapes. The synthesis identified six themes that define the drivers of landscape decisions, and four themes that define the dominant methodological approaches used to generate evidence for landscape decisions. The emergent themes from the synthesis were distilled into five principles that can be used as a basis for the development of a holistic landscape decision framework.

T1  - A Reliability-Optimized Maximum Power Point Tracking Algorithm Utilizing Neural Networks for Long-Term Lifetime Prediction for Photovoltaic Power Converters
AN  - 2857016032
AB  - The reliability of power converters in photovoltaic systems is critical to the overall system reliability. This paper proposes a novel active thermal-controlled algorithm that aims to reduce the rate of junction temperature increase, therefore, increasing the reliability of the device. The algorithm works alongside a normal perturb and observe maximum power point tracking algorithm, taking control when certain temperature criteria are met. In conjunction with a neural network, the algorithm is applied to long-term real mission profile data. This would grant a better understanding of the real-world trade-offs between energy generated and lifetime improvement when using the proposed algorithm, as well as shortening study cycle times. The neural network, when applied to 365 days of data, was 28 times faster than using standard electrothermal modeling, and the lifetime consumption was predicted with greater than 96.5% accuracy. Energy generated was predicted with greater than 99.5% accuracy. The proposed algorithm resulted in a 3.3% reduction in lifetime consumption with a 1.0% reduction in the total energy generated. There is a demonstrated trade-off between lifetime consumption reduction and energy-generated reduction. The results are also split by environmental conditions. Under very variable conditions, the algorithm resulted in a 4.4% reduction in lifetime consumption with a 1.4% reduction in the total energy generated.

T1  - Heatwaves: does global research reflect the growing threat in the light of climate change?
AN  - 2852104235
AB  - BackgroundWith the increasing impacts of climate change, heatwaves are placing an enormous burden on health and social systems and threatening ecological diversity around the world. Heatwaves are increasing not only in frequency but also in severity and magnitude. They are causing the deaths of thousands of people. Research is needed on a multidisciplinary, supra-regional, and regional level.MethodsA detailed evaluation of the research conducted is not yet available. Therefore, this study provides a detailed insight into the publication landscape to identify key players, incentives, and requirements for future scientific efforts that are useful not only for scientists but also to stakeholders and project funders.ResultsThe number of publications on heatwaves is increasing, outpacing the trend of research indexed by the Science Citation Index Expanded. However, funding is lagging behind comparatively. Looking at absolute numbers, the USA, Australia, China, and some European countries have been identified as major players in heatwave research. If socio-economic numbers are included, Switzerland and Portugal lead the way. Australia and the UK dominate if the change in heatwave-exposed people is included. Nevertheless, exposure and economic strength of publishing countries were identified as the main drivers of national research interests. Previous heatwaves, in particular, have driven research efforts primarily at the national level.ConclusionFor an efficient monitoring or early detection system that also includes the economically weak regions, internationally networked efforts are necessary to enable preventive measures and damage limitation against heatwaves. Regardless of previous regional extreme heat events, research approaches should be focused to the global level.

T1  - Development and Validation of the Climate Capability Scale
AN  - 2849119404
AB  - Climate change poses a serious existential threat to life on our planet. If we are to mitigate the most damaging impacts of climate change, there is a need for citizens who are willing and able to make changes to their individual behaviours, but who are also politically engaged and motivated to participate in, and advocate for, systemic change; there is a need for citizens who are Climate Capable. However, there is no scale currently available with which to measure the climate capability of adults and adolescents. Through an iterative process across three studies with 849 UK adults, we developed and validated a 24-item Climate Capability Scale. In a further study, with 458 UK adolescent participants (aged 12–15), we validated the scale for use with adolescents. We demonstrate that the scale is internally consistent, has good test–retest reliability, correlates with measures of related constructs such as environmental worldview and scientific literacy, and predicts self-reported pro-environmental behaviour. The Climate Capability Scale may have particular value in educational and public engagement contexts for measuring the effectiveness of programs and interventions designed to increase Climate Capability, as well as similar approaches to heighten engagement with the climate crisis.

T1  - Scale variance in the carbon dynamics of fragmented, mixed-use landscapes estimated using model–data fusion
AN  - 2848679950
AB  - Many terrestrial landscapes are heterogeneous. Mixed land cover and land use generate a complex mosaic of fragmented ecosystems at fine spatial resolutions with contrasting ecosystem stocks, traits, and processes, each differently sensitive to environmental and human factors. Representing spatial complexity within terrestrial ecosystem models is a key challenge for understanding regional carbon dynamics, their sensitivity to environmental gradients, and their resilience in the face of climate change. Heterogeneity underpins this challenge due to the trade-off between the fidelity of ecosystem representation within modelling frameworks and the computational capacity required for fine-scale model calibration and simulation. We directly address this challenge by quantifying the sensitivity of simulated carbon fluxes in a mixed-use landscape in the UK to the spatial resolution of the model analysis. We test two different approaches for combining Earth observation (EO) data into the CARDAMOM model–data fusion (MDF) framework, assimilating time series of satellite-based EO-derived estimates of ecosystem leaf area and biomass stocks to constrain estimates of model parameters and their uncertainty for an intermediate complexity model of the terrestrial C cycle. In the first approach, ecosystems are calibrated and simulated at pixel level, representing a “community average” of the encompassed land cover and management. This represents our baseline approach. In the second, we stratify each pixel based on land cover (e.g. coniferous forest, arable/pasture) and calibrate the model independently using EO data specific to each stratum. We test the scale dependence of these approaches for grid resolutions spanning 1 to 0.05∘ over a mixed-land-use region of the UK. Our analyses indicate that spatial resolution matters for MDF. Under the community average baseline approach biological C fluxes (gross primary productivity, Reco) simulated by CARDAMOM are relatively insensitive to resolution. However, disturbance fluxes exhibit scale variance that increases with greater landscape fragmentation and for coarser model domains. In contrast, stratification of assimilated data based on fine-resolution land use distributions resolved the resolution dependence, leading to disturbance fluxes that were 40 %–100 % higher than the baseline experiments. The differences in the simulated disturbance fluxes result in estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance in the stratified experiment that suggest a weaker C sink compared to the baseline experiment. We also find that stratifying the model domain based on land use leads to differences in the retrieved parameters that reflect variations in ecosystem function between neighbouring areas of contrasting land use. The emergent differences in model parameters between land use strata give rise to divergent responses to future climate change. Accounting for fine-scale structure in heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. stratification) is therefore vital for ensuring the ecological fidelity of large-scale MDF frameworks. The need for stratification arises because land use places strong controls on the spatial distribution of carbon stocks and plant functional traits and on the ecological processes controlling the fluxes of C through landscapes, particularly those related to management and disturbance. Given the importance of disturbance to global terrestrial C fluxes, together with the widespread increase in fragmentation of forest landscapes, these results carry broader significance for the application of MDF frameworks to constrain the terrestrial C balance at regional and national scales.

T1  - Green Agendas and White Markets: The Coloniality of Agroecology in Senegal
AN  - 2843081405
AB  - Development actors in West Africa have been promoting agroecological farming as a solution to combat climate change and to create more sovereign food systems that enhance the autonomy of local smallholders. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the actual implementation of such programs and their potential to empower smallholders, especially in the West African region. Drawing on co-produced knowledge from anthropological fieldwork in Western Senegal, the case study of an alternative food network explores the interlinkages between the promotion of agroecology, anti-migration policies, and unequal power and market relations. Informed by decolonial political ecologies, the analysis reveals different layers of coloniality which complicate embodied effects on horticultural smallholders. The authors conclude that instead of fostering the emancipation of smallholders, development actors promote a labor-intensive and unprofitable way of farming that exploits local resources for the sake of green agendas and white markets. This article highlights the need for a critical reflection on the potential limitations of agroecology and calls for a more nuanced approach that considers the complex realities of smallholders in West Africa.

T1  - The Risks and Challenges of Electric Vehicle Integration into Smart Cities
AN  - 2843057095
AB  - The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart cities presents a promising opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing urban sustainability. However, there are significant risks and challenges associated with the integration of EVs into smart cities, which must be carefully considered. Though there are various reviews available on the challenges of integrating EVs into smart cities, the majority of these are focused on technical challenges, thereby ignoring other important challenges that may arise from such integration. This paper therefore provides a comprehensive overview of the risks and challenges associated with the integration of EVs into smart cities in one research paper. The different challenges associated with the integration of EVs into smart cities have been identified and categorized into four groups, namely: technical, economic, social, and environmental, while also discussing the associated risks of EV integration into smart cities. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for a holistic approach to EV integration into smart cities that considers these challenges and risks. It also identifies possible future trends and outlooks to address these challenges and promote the successful integration of EVs into smart cities. Overall, this paper provides valuable insights for policymakers, city planners, and researchers working towards sustainable urban transportation systems.

T1  - Assessing Coastal Erosion and Climate Change Adaptation Measures: A Novel Participatory Approach
AN  - 2843051656
AB  - This work aims to provide a more complete characterization of coastal erosion mitigation and climate change adaptation measures by presenting a participatory approach that integrates medium- to long-term perspectives, considering simultaneously social, environmental, economic and engineering dimensions to help decision makers implement sustainable climate change adaptation (CCA) strategies. The work lists, explains and characterizes existing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures as well as their costs and positive and negative social, environmental and economic impacts, in three distinct databases. These databases are discussed, complemented and validated in participatory moments with local stakeholders of the Ovar Municipality, Portugal, which represents the case study to support the proposed methodology. Although Ovar is a pilot case, the integrated framework for resilient CCA has a global application with respect to methodologies and concepts. The proposed approach is useful to help coastal management entities to engage in more efficient, effective and beneficial planned action to mitigate coastal erosion and adapt to future climate change effects. The open-source databases and the participatory approach facilitate decision makers and coastal communities to navigate the complexity of solutions and build consensus around collective actions for coastal areas.

T1  - Investigating the Effects of Parameter Tuning on Machine Learning for Occupant Behavior Analysis in Japanese Residential Buildings
AN  - 2843045401
AB  - Global warming is currently progressing worldwide, and it is important to control greenhouse gas emissions from the perspective of adaptation and mitigation. Occupant behavior is highly individualized and must be analyzed to accurately determine a building’s energy consumption. However, most of the resident behavior models in existing studies are based on statistical methods, and their accuracy in parameter tuning has not been examined. The accuracy of heating behavior prediction has been studied using three different methods: logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN). The generalization ability of the support vector machine and the deep neural network was improved by parameter tuning. The parameter tuning of the SVM showed that the values of C and gamma affected the prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy improved by approximately 11.9%, confirming the effectiveness of parameter tuning on the SVM. The parameter tuning of the DNN showed that the values of the layer and neuron affected prediction accuracy. Although parameter tuning also improved the prediction accuracy of the DNN, the rate of increase was lower than that of the SVM.

T1  - Review of Alternative Sustainable Fuels for Hybrid Rocket Propulsion
AN  - 2842881440
AB  - Hybrid rockets using specific oxidizer–fuel combinations are considered a green alternative to current propulsion systems, as they do not release very toxic or polluting exhausts, but only much less harmful substances such as carbon monoxide/dioxide and soot. However, in a long-term vision where space access and rocket transportation become a daily routine all around the world, the simple use of current green propellants could begin to become insufficient if the rest of the industry already follows much stricter rules, which are expected to tighten significantly in the future, thereby making emissions from rocket flights no more negligible. In this paper, the possible use of alternative sustainable solid fuels for hybrid rockets that are not derived from fossil fuels and are ideally carbon neutral is investigated and discussed based on the available data in the hybrid literature and on the literature related to renewable fuels in general. Even if this topic is apparently far away from the current necessities, as hybrid propulsion is not yet operational, it is paramount to consider a long-term vision and associated research efforts to make sure that the potential hybrid propulsion introduction to the commercial market is more than a simple flash in the pan, but offers a solid opportunity.

T1  - Combining local model calibration with the emergent constraint approach to reduce uncertainty in the tropical land carbon cycle feedback
AN  - 2838150391
AB  - The role of the land carbon cycle in climate change remains highly uncertain. A key source of the projection spread is related to the assumed response of photosynthesis to warming, especially in the tropics. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis determines whether warming  positively or negatively impacts photosynthesis, thereby amplifying or suppressing CO2 fertilisation of photosynthesis under CO2-induced global warming. Land carbon cycle models have been extensively calibrated against local eddy flux measurements, but this has not previously been clearly translated into a reduced uncertainty in terms of how the tropical land carbon sink will respond to warming. Using a previous parameter perturbation ensemble carried out with version 3 of the Hadley Centre coupled climate–carbon cycle model (HadCM3C), we identify an emergent relationship between the optimal temperature for photosynthesis, which is especially relevant in tropical forests, and the projected amount of atmospheric CO2 at the end of the century. We combine this with a constraint on the optimum temperature for photosynthesis, derived from eddy covariance measurements using the adjoint of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. Taken together, the emergent relationship from the coupled model and the constraint on the optimum temperature for photosynthesis define an emergent constraint on future atmospheric CO2 in the HadCM3C coupled climate–carbon cycle under a common emissions scenario (A1B). The emergent constraint sharpens the probability density of simulated CO2 change (2100–1900) and moves its peak to a lower value of 497 ± 91 compared to 607 ± 128 ppmv (parts per million by volume) when using the equal-weight prior. Although this result is likely to be model and scenario dependent, it demonstrates the potential of combining the large-scale emergent constraint approach with a parameter estimation using detailed local measurements.

T1  - The Controversial Link between CSR and Financial Performance: The Mediating Role of Green Innovation
AN  - 2836508264
AB  - The contentious relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been extensively and yet inconclusively debated in the sustainability literature. We further investigate the link between CSR and CFP by examining the mediating role of green innovation performance (GIP). We perform pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis on a panel data of UK firms from 2006 to 2017 provided by the ASSET4 database. We find that CSR is positively and significantly associated with CFP and that GIP plays a significant and positive mediating role in this relationship. Our findings contribute to the extant sustainability literature by using a comprehensive measure of CFP and addressing the mediating effects of GIP on the link between CSR and CFP. The results provide policy, practice, and research implications as investors demand more robust CSR information, regulators establish environmental and climate change rules, and companies focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of their green innovation practices and performance.

T1  - Wind Farm Control for Improved Battery Lifetime in Green Hydrogen Systems without a Grid Connection
AN  - 2836390687
AB  - Green hydrogen is likely to play an important role in meeting the net-zero targets of countries around the globe. One potential option for green hydrogen production is to run electrolysers directly from offshore wind turbines, with no grid connection and hence no expensive cabling to shore. In this work, an innovative proof of concept of a wind farm control methodology designed to reduce variability in wind farm active power output is presented. Smoothing the power supplied by the wind farm to the battery reduces the size and number of battery charge cycles and helps to increase battery lifetime. This work quantifies the impact of the wind farm control method on battery lifetime for wind farms of 1, 4, 9 and 16 wind turbines using suitable wind farm, battery and electrolyser models. The work presented shows that wind farm control for smoothing wind farm power output could play a critical role in reducing the levelised cost of green hydrogen produced from wind farms with no grid connection by reducing the damaging load cycles on batteries in the system. Hence, this work paves the way for the design and testing of a full implementation of the wind farm controller.

T1  - The Influence of Storage and Cooking on the Vitamin D Content of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3-Enriched Eggs
AN  - 2836357200
AB  - Food fortification is an effective approach to improve vitamin D (VD) concentrations in foods. Eggs are a useful food vehicle for enrichment with VD via its hydroxylated metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-D3), in hen feed. This study determined the impact of time of lay, storage conditions (ambient and refrigeration) and common cooking methods (boiling, frying, scrambling, poaching and microwaving) on the vitamin D metabolite concentration of eggs enriched with 25-D3. Processed samples were freeze-dried and analysed for D3 and 25-D3 using an HPLC-MS(/MS) method. The results indicated that storage and cooking practices influence VD metabolites, with 25-D3 showing true retention of 72–111% and concentrations of 0.67–0.96 µg/100 g of whole egg. Vitamin D3 showed true retention of 50–152% and concentrations of 0.11–0.61 µg/100 g of whole egg. Depending on the storage and method of cooking applied, the calculated total VD activity of enriched eggs ranged from 3.45 to 5.43 µg/100 g of whole egg and was 22–132% higher in comparison to standardised VD content for non-enriched British eggs. The study suggests that 25-D3 is a stable metabolite in eggs following storage and cooking, and that 25-D3-enriched eggs may serve as a potent dietary source of VD.

T1  - AlgaeTraits: a trait database for (European) seaweeds
AN  - 2832681810
AB  - The analysis of biological and ecological traits has a long history in evolutionary and ecological research. However, trait data are often scattered and standardised terminology that transcends taxonomic and biogeographical context are generally missing. As part of the development of a global trait database of marine species, we collated trait information for European seaweeds and structured the data within the standardised framework of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). We collected 45 175 trait records for 21 biologically and ecologically relevant traits of seaweeds. This resulted in a trait database for 1745 European seaweed species of which more than half (56 %) of the records were documented at the species level, while the remaining 44 % were documented at a higher taxonomic level and subsequently inherited at lower levels. The trait database for European seaweeds will serve as a foundation for future research on diversity and evolution of seaweeds and their responses to global changes. The data will contribute to developing detailed trait-based ecosystem models and will be an important tool to inform marine conservation policies. The data are publicly accessible through the AlgaeTraits portal,  10.14284/574 (AlgaeTraits, 2022).

T1  - Repurposing Dredged Canal Sediment for Topsoil at Bowling, Scotland
AN  - 2829884002
AB  - The aim of the SURICATES (Sediment Uses as Resources in Circular And Territorial EconomieS) Project is to increase sediment reuse for erosion and flood protection. To investigate potential opportunities to reuse dredged sediments as topsoil following phyto-conditioning, a pilot scale operation was undertaken at Bowling, Scotland. As part of normal maintenance, 550 m3 of wet sediment was removed from the Forth and Clyde Canal at Old Kilpatrick by Scottish Canals using a hydraulic excavator during September 2020, transported by barge, then transferred to a dewatering cell constructed in an old canal basin by lining with a geotextile break-layer and installing engineered drainage. Following initial dewatering, the sediment was sown with three varieties of grass, which each germinated and survived the winter. By March 2021 composite soil samples already met the BS 3882:2015 criteria for topsoil, other than for Zn levels, which reflected the locally elevated baseline values. This allowed the conditioned sediment to be used immediately as topsoil as part of the nearby construction of a long-distance cycle track following an old railway embankment. Following reuse, replicated validations of six grass or wildflower seed mixtures were sown in April 2021 and monitored to verify longer-term suitability as a landscaping soil.

T1  - Experiences from a School–University Partnership Climate and Sustainability Education Project in England: The Value of Citizen Science and Practical STEM Approaches
AN  - 2829881566
AB  - Extracurricular citizen science and hands-on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths) projects can ensure that climate and sustainability education is not just superficial but truly transformative. Through working under the guidance of academic partners, young people can develop a deep appreciation for climate science and, most importantly, become aware of the real-world sustainable solutions being developed to address the consequences of our changing climate. We present the experiences of four stakeholders from one case study involving middle school students (9–13 years) and their teachers working on a climate change and sustainable drainage system (SuDS) project with academics from Newcastle University and the Schools Engagement programme of the Royal Society. We found that all stakeholders considered it to be a successful project with significant benefits, including engaging learning in the pupils, a challenge for the teachers, and meaningful data collection for the academic team. The funding organisation thought the positive interactions that they try to encourage between students and STEM partners were evidenced in this project perfectly. Young people are future decision makers; this type of project can enable them to develop essential skills and an understanding of a range of STEM careers. Subsequent developments may include refining the way similar projects are run.

T1  - Territorial and Consumption-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions Assessments: Implications for Spatial Planning Policies
AN  - 2829820526
AB  - The quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is increasingly important in spatial planning for regions, cities, and areas. The combination of territorial and consumption-based accounting (CBA) approaches can currently be considered best practice for calculating GHG emissions at sub-national levels, in terms of informing local decision-making about the different climate impacts of spatial planning policies, both within the boundaries of a given region and for the inhabitants of that region. This study introduces four European case studies that were conducted using the two quantification approaches to assess the climate impacts of locally relevant planning policies. The case studies represent different scales of spatial planning, different European planning systems, and different situations in terms of data availability. Territorial results are not suitable for inter-regional comparison, but rather for internal monitoring, while CBA allows for comparison and provides a comprehensive picture of the global carbon footprint of residents, however, with indications that are more difficult to link to spatial planning decisions. Assessing impacts, and in particular interpreting results, requires both methodological understanding and knowledge of the local context. The results of the case studies show that setting climate targets and monitoring the success of climate action through a single net emissions figure can give false indications. The study shows that the two approaches to quantifying GHG emissions provide complementary perspectives on GHG emissions at the sub-national level and thus provide a more thorough understanding of the GHG emission patterns associated with spatial planning policies. The identification of the regional differences in GHG emission sources and mitigation potentials are the main functions of sub-national GHG inventories and the impact assessment for spatial planning. Harmonization of the data collection for sub-national GHG inventories and the transparency of underlying assumptions would greatly support the coherence of climate action and the implications to spatial planning.

T1  - The Impact of Institutional Innovation on a Public Tender: The Case of Madrid Metropolitan Forest
AN  - 2829819861
AB  - The introduction of forests in cities has been an observable trend in recent years, with planned forest management projects proliferating around the world. The fact that many urban forests in the public space are traditionally managed by top-down bureaucratic procedures and guided by expert knowledge raises questions about whether green areas should follow the same management approach as other urban infrastructures, such as mobility infrastructures, or whether they should explore a collaborative approach designed to engage diverse stakeholders. This article examines the challenges of innovating in urban forests, changing the management rules that may limit participatory and deliberative processes to support decision-making. In particular, we analyzed how introducing a co-creation stage impacted the traditional competitive public tender procedure in the Madrid Metropolitan Forest project, using the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. Results showed that the costs and benefits of innovation differ among involved actors, generating unintended deterrent effects for experimentation. To mitigate these decoupling effects, we suggest a strategic design of working rules and updating the shared incentive to move from a competitive and transactional logic to a more collaborative and co-creative form of connection.

T1  - Is the Impact of the European Mouflon on Vegetation Influenced by the Allochthonous Nature of the Species?
AN  - 2829794938
AB  - The mouflon (Ovis gmelini musimon) is an introduced ungulate in continental Europe. It has adapted well to its occupied habitats over the last 150 years. Its growing population has drawn increasing attention to its impact on autochthonous species, especially in endangered ecosystems. Its allochthonous character, habitat selection, and feeding led scientists to question the raison d’etre of mouflons. The mouflon’s space use and foraging strategies highlighted some pressure elements it exerts on those habitats. Mouflon trampling damage may be behind the degradation of rare, endangered grasslands. We review studies to discuss the results and the limitations of exclusion experiments to evaluate the extent of mouflon-caused damage in the context of population density. We review the forest damage attributed to mouflons considering interspecies competition with other large herbivores such as red deer (Cervus elaphus) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). Climate change makes the mouflon use its space differently when seeking shelter in southern habitats; consequently, the increased trampling and foraging pressures suggest new challenges in managing its impact. We review research results on these direct impacts of the species; however, the long-term effects on herbaceous plant communities, such as rock grasslands, are still unclear. This is true for the mouflon’s influence under changing population dynamics. Our results intend to set directions for future research on long-term experiments with density impact, coexistence with red deer or chamois, and warming-climate-driven behavior change.

T1  - The Long-Term Course of the Annual Total Sunshine Duration in Europe and Changes in the Phases of the Thermohaline Circulation in the North Atlantic (1901–2018)
AN  - 2829793343
AB  - The current study was based on sunshine duration data from 13 European stations during 1901–2018. It was found that the variability in the annual total sunshine duration (SD) over Europe is related to the variability in the component of the surface thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic (NA THC). Positive NA THC phases (the condition of the ‘warm’ North Atlantic) correspond to the periods of increased SD (brightening), while negative phases correspond to the periods of decreased SD (dimming). These relationships remain stable and statistically significant. The mechanism of these relationships is based on the influence of weakened or enhanced heat flow from the ocean to the atmosphere on the course of the mid-tropospheric circulation processes. In periods of positive thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic (NA THC) phases, the share of long waves (macrotype W according to the Wangengejm–Girs classification) increases, with the occurrence of which the frequency of anticyclonic weather over Europe increases, whereas in the periods of negative NA THC phases, the share of shorter waves (macrotypes E and C) increases, with the occurrence of which the frequency of cyclonic (frontal) weather over Europe increases. It is characterised by increased layer cloud cover, limiting the SD. Thus, along with changes in the thermal condition of the North Atlantic, the structure of cloud cover over Europe changes and becomes a factor regulating long-term changes in the annual total SD.

T1  - Indoor Air Quality and Thermal Environment Assessment of Scottish Homes with Different Building Fabrics
AN  - 2829777611
AB  - The ongoing climate change and policies around it are changing how we design and build homes to meet national carbon emission targets. Some countries such as Scotland are adopting higher-energy-efficient buildings as minimum requirements in the building regulations. While net zero homes might be more energy-efficient and emit fewer operational carbon emissions, we have yet to fully understand the influence on the indoor environment, particularly on indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort. This study compares the IAQ of three homes in Scotland with equal internal layouts and designs but different building fabrics. The homes represent the minimum Scottish building regulations (2015), the Passivhaus standard and the Scottish ‘Gold Standard’. Temperature, relative humidity, PM2.5 and total volatile organic compounds (tVOC) were measured at five-minute intervals for seven months and compared to occupants’ subjective responses to the IAQ. All three homes had temperatures above the recommended thresholds for overheating. Measured hygrothermal conditions were within the ideal range 66.4% of the time in the Passivhaus, 56.4% in the Gold Standard home and 62.7% in the control home. Measured IAQ was better in homes with higher energy efficiency, particularly tVOC. For instance, indoor PM2.5 in the Passivhaus were 78.0% of the time below the threshold, while in the standard home the figure was 51.5%, with a weak correlation with outdoor PM2.5 (Passivhaus: B rs = 0.167, K rs = 0.306 and L rs = 0.163 (p < 0.001); Gold: B rs = −0.157, K rs = 0.322 and L rs = 0.340 (p < 0.001); Control: B rs = −0.111, K rs = 0.235 and L rs = 0.235 (p < 0.001)). TVOCs in the Passivhaus were 81.3%, while in the control home they were 55.0%. While the results cannot be generalised, due to the small sample, this study has significant policy implications, particularly in Scotland, exhibiting the importance of IAQ in current building legislation and sustainable assessment methods.

T1  - Road Pavement, Road Pollution, and Sustainability under Climate Change Increased Temperature
AN  - 2829707378
AB  - This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to understand the impacts of temperature increase on the retention of particulate pollutants, such as heavy metals and microplastics, by the road pavement material. A soil with a particle size distribution similar to road dust was selected. A Wheel Tracking device was used to assess the permanent deformation behavior of prismatic specimens and the retention of the dust, at controlled temperatures of 40 °C and 60 °C, likely to occur on pavement in the future. The soil representing road pollutants was placed at the top of the slabs prior to the Wheel Tracking Test (WTT), based on the European Standard EN 12697-22:2020. After the WTT, two common methods were used, in order to evaluate the soil retention (pollution accumulation) on road pavement. The results confirm that the viscoelastic behavior of bituminous mixtures under increased temperatures can contribute to particle retention at the pavement. Future studies are needed to understand the phenomena, the retention characteristics by different bituminous mixtures, and the efficiency of pollutants capture. The work opens the opportunity to develop innovative road pavement bituminous mixtures that can reduce the discharge of road particulate pollutants, and have increased resilience and sustainability in extreme weather conditions.

T1  - The UKSCAPE-G2G river flow and soil moisture datasets: Grid-to-Grid model estimates for the UK for historical and potential future climates
AN  - 2827829008
AB  - Appropriate adaptation planning is contingent upon information about the potential future impacts of climate change, and hydrological impact assessments are of particular importance. The UKSCAPE-G2G datasets were produced, as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) UK-SCAPE (UK Status, Change and Projections of the Environment) programme, to contribute to this information requirement. They use the Grid-to-Grid (G2G) national-scale hydrological model configured for both Great Britain and Northern Ireland (and the parts of the Republic of Ireland that drain to rivers in NI). Six separate datasets are provided, for two sets of driving data – one observation-based (1980–2011) and one climate-projection-based (1980–2080) – for both river flows and soil moisture on 1 km × 1 km grids across Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The river flow datasets include grids of monthly mean flow, annual maxima of daily mean flow, and annual minima of 7 d mean flow (m3 s-1). The soil moisture datasets are grids of monthly mean soil moisture content (m water / m soil), which should be interpreted as depth-integrated values for the whole soil column. The climate-projection-based datasets are produced using data from the 12-member 12 km regional climate model ensemble of the latest UK climate projections (UKCP18), which uses RCP8.5 emissions. The production of the datasets is described, along with details of the file format and how the data should be used. Example maps are provided, as well as simple UK-wide analyses of the various outputs. These suggest potential future decreases in summer flows, annual minimum 7 d flows, and summer/autumn soil moisture, along with possible future increases in winter flows and annual maximum flows. References are given for published papers providing more detailed spatial analyses, and some further potential uses of the data are suggested. The datasets are listed in Table 1.

T1  - Carbon Monitor Europe near-real-time daily CO2 emissions for 27 EU countries and the United Kingdom
AN  - 2825537760
AB  - With the urgent need to implement the EU countries pledges and to monitor the effectiveness of Green Deal plan, Monitoring Reporting and Verification tools are needed to track how emissions are changing for all the sectors. Current official inventories only provide annual estimates of national CO2 emissions with a lag of 1+ year which do not capture the variations of emissions due to recent shocks including COVID lockdowns and economic rebounds, war in Ukraine. Here we present a near-real-time country-level dataset of daily fossil fuel and cement emissions from January 2019 through December 2021 for 27 EU countries and UK, which called Carbon Monitor Europe. The data are calculated separately for six sectors: power, industry, ground transportation, domestic aviation, international aviation and residential. Daily CO2 emissions are estimated from a large set of activity data compiled from different sources. The goal of this dataset is to improve the timeliness and temporal resolution of emissions for European countries, to inform the public and decision makers about current emissions changes in Europe.

T1  - The future of meat and dairy consumption in the UK: exploring different policy scenarios to meet net zero targets and improve population health
AN  - 2825100143
AB  - Non-Technical SummaryTo meet the UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) recommended to reduce current meat and dairy intake by 20% by 2030. In this study, we modelled the impact of potential dietary changes on GHG emissions and water use with the selected scenarios based on the trend of food purchase and meat and dairy reduction policy. We show that implementing fiscal measures and facilitating innovations in production of meat alternatives would accelerate existing positive trends, help the UK reach the CCC 2030 target of 20% meat and dairy reduction and increase fruit and vegetable intake.Technical SummaryWe used 2001–2019 data from the Family Food module of the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), an annual UK survey of about 5,000 representative households recording quantities of all food and drink purchases, to model four 2030 dietary scenarios: Business as usual (BAU); two fiscal policy scenarios (‘fiscal 10%’ and ‘fiscal 20%’), combining either a 10% meat and dairy tax and a 10% fruit and vegetable subsidy, or a 20% tax and 20% subsidy on the same foods; and an ‘innovation scenario’ substituting traditionally-produced meat and dairy with plant-based analogues and animal proteins produced in laboratories. Compared to 2019 levels, we forecasted reductions in the range of 5–30% for meat and 8–32% for dairy across scenarios. Meat reductions could be up to 21.5% (fiscal20%) and 30.4% (innovation). For all scenarios we forecasted an increase in fruit and vegetables intake in the range of 3–13.5%; with the fiscal 20% scenario showing highest increases (13.5%). GHG emissions and water use reductions were highest for the innovation scenario (−19.8%, −16.2%) followed by fiscal 20% (−15.8%, −9.2%) fiscal 10% (−12.1%, 5.9%) and BAU (−8.3%, −2.6%) scenarios. Compared to average households, low-income households had similar patterns of change, but both past and predicted purchase of meat, fruit and vegetables and environmental footprints were lower.Social Media SummaryMeat and dairy-reduction policies would help meet net zero targets and improve population health in the UK.

T1  - Interventions to Strengthen Environmental Sustainability of School Food Systems: Narrative Scoping Review
AN  - 2823986217
AB  - School food systems play a role in the wider food system, but there is a scarcity of literature exploring interventions that aim to improve the environmental sustainability of school food systems. The present review aimed to understand and describe the types of interventions that have previously been explored to strengthen the sustainability of school food systems along with their impact. We applied a scoping review methodology guided by Arksey and O’Malley, which included a review of the online database Scopus and the grey literature. Information relating to intervention design, study population, evaluation method and impact were extracted. In total, 6016 records were screened for eligibility, 24 of which were eligible for inclusion. The most common types of interventions were school lunch menus designed to be more sustainable; school food waste reduction; sustainable food system education using school gardens; and dietary interventions with added environmental components. This review highlights a range of interventions which could positively influence the environmental sustainability of school food systems. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of such interventions.

T1  - Sports Utility Vehicles: A Public Health Model of Their Climate and Air Pollution Impacts in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2823985465
AB  - The emission benefits of shifting towards battery electric vehicles have so far been hampered by a trend towards sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This study assesses the current and future emissions from SUVs and their potential impact on public health and climate targets. We modelled five scenarios of varying SUV sales and electrification rates, and projected associated carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the relationship between vehicle characteristics and emissions. Cumulative CO2 emissions were valued using the social cost of carbon approach. Life table analyses were used to project and value life years saved from NOx emission reductions. Larger SUVs were disproportionately high emitters of CO2 and NOx. Replacing these with small SUVs achieved significant benefits, saving 702 MtCO2e by 2050 and 1.8 million life years from NO2 reductions. The largest benefits were achieved when combined with electrification, saving 1181 MtCO2e and gaining 3.7 million life years, with a societal value in the range of GBP 10–100s billion(s). Downsizing SUVs could be associated with major public health benefits from reduced CO2 and NOx emissions, in addition to the benefits of electrification. This could be achieved by demand-side mass-based vehicle taxation and supply-side changes to regulations, by tying emission limits to a vehicle’s footprint rather than its mass.

T1  - Parametric Assessment of Building Heating Demand for Different Levels of Details and User Comfort Levels: A Case Study in London, UK
AN  - 2819494315
AB  - The Level of Detail (LoD), a parameter used to define the information contained in building models, is an important factor to consider in modeling building energy at the urban scale. In this research, we conducted a parametric study regarding the data requirements for the estimation of the annual residential heat demand in London. More particularly, the requirement of the observation of the actual roof type (LoD2) and the window-to-wall ratio (LoD3) was examined in two different case study areas. Meanwhile, an adaptive comfort level study was implemented using LoD5 models, and its results were assessed holistically with the heat demand to reveal the energy performance of the buildings. The results showed that there was a minor difference in the upgrade of a lower to higher LoD regarding these parameters. At an urban scale, the energy demand of buildings could be estimated using an assumption of archetypes and building ages. However, with a scalable parametric script developed in places, models with a high LoD could provide more detailed insights in the energy performance assessment without generating excessive workload.

T1  - Unexpected Challenges in the Modular Construction Implementation: Are UK Contractors Ready?
AN  - 2819493191
AB  - Despite the growing attention given to modular construction in the UK, a lack of investigation into the practical challenges and limitations experienced by contractors has been noted. Hence, this study aims to critically assess the feasibility of volumetric modular construction from the perspective of contractors who have applied this method in real-world projects. The study adopted a qualitative research approach using a case study technique and selected two modular construction projects in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, as case studies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine professionals from the contracting organisations involved in these projects in addition to project document reviews from the selected cases and data analysis using a content analysis approach. The study found that while modular construction can be costly, it is appreciated by contractors for its ability to reduce construction schedules and save costs. However, program delays, skill gaps, and reduced design flexibility pose significant challenges. This study offers unique insights into the practical challenges and limitations of volumetric modular construction and provides recommendations for improvement. Its contribution to the body of knowledge is significant as it sheds light on the trade-offs involved in using modular construction and highlights the need for further research to enhance its application in real-world projects.

T1  - Investigating the Impact of Shifting the Brick Kiln Industry from Conventional to Zigzag Technology for a Sustainable Environment
AN  - 2819492082
AB  - The brick kiln industry is one of the largest and most highly unregulated industrial sectors in developing countries. Most of the kilns use low-quality coal as primary fuel along with small quantities of bagasse, rice husk, and wooden chips. As a result of inefficient methods of combustion in conventional brick kilns, such as fixed chimney Bull’s trench kilns (FCBTKs), harmful pollutants are emitted in high quantities, which ultimately deteriorate the environment and are widely in operation in Pakistan. The most prominent harmful pollutants include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), black carbon (BC), and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Over the years, new technologies have been adopted by developed countries for the reduction of environmental burdens. One of these technologies is induced draught zigzag kilns (IDZKs), or zigzag kilns (ZZKs), technology, which effectively improves the combustion across the path of bricks stacked in a zigzag pattern. For the mass adoption of this technology, environmental assessment and comparison of both technologies is a crucial step. Both types of kiln sites are investigated for the analysis of their emissions and their environmental impact in this work. Carbon mass balance equations are used for the calculation of emission factors. Collected inventory data is then used for the life cycle assessment of both types of kilns using open LCA (version 1.10.3) and the Eco-invent database. According to the study, ZZK technology outperforms FCBTK in all aspects. The analysis of the specific energy consumption (SEC) of fired bricks for each kiln type reveals that ZZKs require 30% less energy than the conventional FCBTK. This implies that ZZKs demand lesser fuel than FCBTKs. The zigzag technology adoption scenario, in particular, can lead to approximately 30% lower CO2 emissions, which can be further reduced by up to 80% when taking into account black carbon (BC) emissions. Additionally, the adoption of zigzag technology can result in a 35% decrease in PM2.5 emissions. The study shows that adopting ZZK technology significantly reduces impact categories, such as particulate matter formation (PMF), photochemical oxidant formation (POF), and terrestrial acidification (TA) by 63%, 93%, and 95%, respectively.

T1  - Testing the Effect of Relative Pollen Productivity on the REVEALS Model: A Validated Reconstruction of Europe-Wide Holocene Vegetation
AN  - 2819465394
AB  - Reliable quantitative vegetation reconstructions for Europe during the Holocene are crucial to improving our understanding of landscape dynamics, making it possible to assess the past effects of environmental variables and land-use change on ecosystems and biodiversity, and mitigating their effects in the future. We present here the most spatially extensive and temporally continuous pollen-based reconstructions of plant cover in Europe (at a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°) over the Holocene (last 11.7 ka BP) using the ‘Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites’ (REVEALS) model. This study has three main aims. First, to present the most accurate and reliable generation of REVEALS reconstructions across Europe so far. This has been achieved by including a larger number of pollen records compared to former analyses, in particular from the Mediterranean area. Second, to discuss methodological issues in the quantification of past land cover by using alternative datasets of relative pollen productivities (RPPs), one of the key input parameters of REVEALS, to test model sensitivity. Finally, to validate our reconstructions with the global forest change dataset. The results suggest that the RPPs.st1 (31 taxa) dataset is best suited to producing regional vegetation cover estimates for Europe. These reconstructions offer a long-term perspective providing unique possibilities to explore spatial-temporal changes in past land cover and biodiversity.

T1  - Fungal Aeroallergens—The Impact of Climate Change
AN  - 2819458963
AB  - The incidence of allergic diseases worldwide is rapidly increasing, making allergies a modern pandemic. This article intends to review published reports addressing the role of fungi as causative agents in the development of various overreactivity-related diseases, mainly affecting the respiratory tract. After presenting the basic information on the mechanisms of allergic reactions, we describe the impact of fungal allergens on the development of the allergic diseases. Human activity and climate change have an impact on the spread of fungi and their plant hosts. Particular attention should be paid to microfungi, i.e., plant parasites that may be an underestimated source of new allergens.

T1  - No Observed Effects of Subsea Renewable Energy Infrastructure on Benthic Environments
AN  - 2819457583
AB  - For the tidal energy industry to move forward to commercialisation, understanding the interaction between the environment and tidal energy converters (TEC) is essential. The benthic environment may be particularly vulnerable to development by changing the existing physical and ecological characteristics. To assess measurable changes of the infrastructural and operation activity of the Deep Green subsea TEC known as the kite, developed by Minesto, benthic surveys were carried out in the Narrows, Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. At the Minesto site and two other locations, scientific divers carried out circular cardinal-direction benthic camera surveys prior to and after five years of operation. A diverse assemblage of sessile, vagile and mobile species associated with substrate types were identified. No significant changes at any of the sites were recorded in the abundance of species, substrate type or species diversity over the five-year period. The results show that no impact on benthic communities was detected as a result of the operation and deployment of the infrastructure associated with the technology.

T1  - Prescribed Fire in UK Heather-Dominated Blanket Bog Peatlands: A Critical Review of “Carbon Storage and Sequestration by Habitat: A Review of the Evidence (Second Edition)” by Gregg et al., 2021
AN  - 2819443138
AB  - Peatlands are a vast global carbon store. Both climate change and management have shaped peatlands over millennia, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively. Across the globe, prescribed fire is an important and well-recognised vegetation management tool used to promote biodiversity, increase habitat heterogeneity and mitigate uncontrolled wildfires. However, in the UK, there is an ongoing debate about the efficacy and legitimacy of using prescribed fire as a vegetation management tool. The debate centres around the extent to which prescribed burning is associated with a decline in habitat status and ecological function, especially in relation to carbon storage within heather-dominated blanket bog peatlands. Robust reviews of the evidence base are thus required to disentangle this debate and inform land management policies that ensure the protection and enhancement of blanket bog ecological functioning. Here, we critically review “Carbon storage and sequestration by habitat: a review of the evidence (second edition)” by Gregg et al., 2021. We see the value in synthesising the evidence on this topic but question the methodological approach used by Gregg et al. Another concern is their misrepresentation of evidence relating to prescribed burning impacts on blanket bog ecosystems and carbon budgets. We highlight these issues by focusing on the relevant peatland sections within the review by Gregg et al. and conclude by making a series of recommendations to improve the review’s scientific robustness and, thereby, its value to academics, land managers and policymakers.

T1  - Towards Carbon-Neutral Cities: Urban Classification Based on Physical Environment and Carbon Emission Characteristics
AN  - 2819443100
AB  - Cities are highly industrialized and populated areas and major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. For carbon neutrality, examining the correlation between urban characteristics and greenhouse gas emissions is necessary. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of each city from a carbon neutrality perspective. As such, we conducted a carbon-neutral city analysis. First, the physical environmental variables of 250 municipal, county, and district local governments were collected and constructed and then reduced and purified through factor analysis. Second, the type was derived by performing cluster analysis on the reduced factor variables and carbon emissions by analysis unit. Finally, the characteristics of each type were analyzed, and the carbon-neutral city planning and applicable carbon-neutral technology fields were proposed according to the characteristics. After the categorization of carbon-neutral cities throughout Korea, six cluster types were derived; cities in each cluster had similar characteristics. This study suggests that solutions for carbon reduction should be applied by comprehensively considering the social, economic, and environmental characteristics of each city. It concludes that regional physical environmental indicators and energy consumption statistics can be used comprehensively to establish effective policies and apply technologies and techniques at the local government level.

T1  - An Overview of Permanent Grassland Grazing Management Practices and the Impacts on Principal Soil Quality Indicators
AN  - 2819263561
AB  - Grasslands are at risk of degradation due to unsustainable management practices and climate change. Here, we review the principal soil quality indicators (SQIs) to evaluate the sustainability of different grassland management practices globally. We discuss the importance of SQI assessment and the Soil Quality Minimum Dataset (MDS) specifically in the context of grasslands. We then review two potential solutions, the first of which is adopting grazing management, whereby sustainable grazing management plans (GMPs) offer great potential. The other solution is the development and adoption of novel grassland species, which may improve either drought resistance or infiltration rates, erosion and flooding. Sustainable grassland soil management can promote ecosystem service delivery and improve the resilience of the entire grassland ecosystem to anthropogenic change.

T1  - Effect of Climatic Conditions, and Agronomic Practices Used in Organic and Conventional Crop Production on Yield and Nutritional Composition Parameters in Potato, Cabbage, Lettuce and Onion; Results from the Long-Term NFSC-Trials
AN  - 2819263447
AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that the reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides and mineral fertilizers in agriculture has significant negative environmental and/or health impacts and poses a risk for future food security. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses showed that organic production systems, which omit the use of agrochemicals, produce crops with lower yields, but superior nutritional composition. However, the agronomic parameters responsible for differences in crop yields and nutritional quality are poorly understood. Methods: Here we report results for four field vegetable crops from the Nafferton Factorial Systems Comparison (NFSC) trial. This long-term factorial field experiment was designed to (i) identify effects of growing season/climatic variation, and contrasting rotational designs, crop protection protocols and fertilization regimes used in organic and conventional systems on crop health, yield and nutritional parameters and (ii) estimate the relative importance of climatic and agronomic drivers for crop health, yield and nutritionally relevant quality parameters. Quality parameters monitored in harvested products, included phenolic, glucosinolate, vitamin C, vitamin B9, carotenoid, cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and glycoalkaloid concentrations. Results: Climatic conditions during the growing season were found to have a larger impact on crop yield and quality than the agronomic factors (pre-crop, crop protection, fertilization) studied. However, the (i) interactions between growing season with contrasting climatic conditions and agronomic factors identified by ANOVA for crop health, yield and quality parameters and (ii) the associations between the three climatic drivers (precipitation, temperature, radiation) and crop yield and quality parameters differed substantially between the four crop plant species. Among the agronomic factors, fertilization had a substantially larger impact compared with both pre-crop and crop protection. Specifically, crop yields were found to be significantly increased by the use of (i) conventional fertilization and crop protection methods in potato, (ii) conventional fertilization, but organic crop protection methods in cabbage, and (iii) conventional fertilization regimes in lettuce, while none of the agronomic factors had a significant effect on onion yields. When important crop pest and diseases were assessed, (i) conventional crop protection resulted in significantly lower late blight severity in potato, while (ii) organic crop protection resulted in lower bird damage and cabbage root fly (CRF) incidence in cabbages, and Sclerotinia incidence in lettuce and (iii) organic fertilization resulted in lower CRF and Sclerotinia incidence in cabbage and lettuce respectively. When concentrations of nutritionally relevant phytochemicals were compared, organic fertilization resulted in significantly higher phenolic concentrations in potato, cabbage and lettuce, higher glucosinolate and carotenoid concentrations in cabbage, higher vitamin C concentrations in potato and cabbage and higher vitamin B9 concentrations in potato and lettuce—but lower concentrations of toxic glycoalkaloids in potato. Significant effects of crop protection protocols on phytochemical concentrations were only detected in cabbage with conventional crop protection resulting in higher glucosinolate and vitamin B9 concentrations. When toxic metal concentrations were compared, organic fertilization resulted in significantly lower Cd concentrations in all four crops and lower Ni concentrations in potato, cabbage and onion. Significant effects of crop protection were only detected in cabbage, where organic crop protection resulted in lower Ni concentrations. Pb concentrations were not affected by any of the agronomic factors. The potential implications of results for improving (i) strategies to reduce the use of non-renewable resources and environmental impacts of vegetable production and (ii) the productivity of organic and other low-input vegetable production systems without compromising food quality are discussed. Conclusions: The study confirms that organic vegetable production protocols result in higher concentrations of phenolics and other nutritionally desirable phytochemicals, but lower concentrations of the toxic metals Cd and Ni in harvested products. It also demonstrates, for the first time, that this is primarily due to differences in fertilization regimes. The finding that in three of the four crops (cabbage, lettuce and onion) the application of synthetic chemical crop protection products had no measurable positive impact on crop health and yield should be considered in the context of the growing concern about health impacts of pesticide use in field vegetable crops.

T1  - Study protocol for two pilot randomised controlled trials aimed at increasing physical activity using electrically assisted bicycles to enhance prostate or breast cancer survival
AN  - 2815654504
AB  - BackgroundIn 2020, 1.4 and 2.3 million new cases of prostate cancer and breast cancer respectively were diagnosed globally. In the UK, prostate cancer is the most common male cancer, while breast cancer is the most common female cancer. Engaging in physical activity (PA) is a key component of treatment. However, rates of PA are low in these clinical populations. This paper describes the protocol of CRANK-P and CRANK-B, two pilot randomised controlled trials, involving an e-cycling intervention aimed at increasing PA in individuals with prostate cancer or breast cancer respectively.MethodsThese two trials are single-centre, stratified, parallel-group, two-arm randomised waitlist-controlled pilot trials in which forty individuals with prostate cancer (CRANK-P) and forty individuals with breast cancer (CRANK-B) will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 allocation ratio, to an e-cycling intervention or waitlist control. The intervention consists of e-bike training with a certified cycle instructor, followed by the provision of an e-bike for 12 weeks. Following the intervention period, participants in the e-bike condition will be directed to community-based initiatives through which they can access an e-bike. Data will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately post intervention (T1) and at 3-month follow-up (T2). In addition, in the intervention group, data will be collected during the intervention and follow-up periods. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used. The primary objectives are to determine effective recruitment strategies, establish recruitment and consent rates, adherence and retention in the study, and determine the feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures and intervention. The potential impact of the intervention on clinical, physiological and behavioural outcomes will be assessed to examine intervention promise. Data analyses will be descriptive.DiscussionThe findings from these trials will provide information on trial feasibility and highlight the potential of e-cycling as a strategy to positively impact the health and behaviour of individuals with prostate cancer and breast cancer. If appropriate, this information can be used to design and deliver a fully powered definitive trial.Trial registrationCRANK-B: [ISRCTN39112034]. CRANK-P [ISRCTN42852156].

T1  - Phygitally Smarter? A Critically Pragmatic Agenda for Smarter Engagement in British Planning and Beyond
AN  - 2813313205
AB  - In Britain as elsewhere, planning systems are entering a “digital turn.” However, the emerging conversations around PlanTech in policy, industry, and research yield contrasting views about the promises of digital technology and “data-driven” decisions to enhance and embed public participation in the planning system. With faster, data-driven processes capable of engaging more people in more diverse ways, PlanTech offers to revolutionise planning systems. However, empirical evidence demonstrates low citizen trust in government and web-based technologies, democratic and participatory deficits, the complexity of the planning system and its opaque technocratic terminology, multi-layered digital divides, and other socio-technical factors that hinder effective and inclusive public consultations in planning. This article provides a preliminary, high-level research agenda for public consultations across Britain’s three nations that centres around a critical pragmatic design, deployment, and evaluation of blended/“phygital” (simultaneously physical and digital) information-rich ecologies of smart engagement. A review of selected national policy in Britain provides initial insight into the emphasis (or lack of) put on the adoption of digital tools within the planning process of each British nation. In doing so, the research sets out a conceptual model that complements existing models for participatory planning by adopting Beyon-Davies’ unified conception of information, systems, and technology. The conceptual model presented sets out seven Is of information-rich phygital ecologies and three interdependent “pillars” for smart engagement that enable one to gaze both deeply and broadly into opportunities for smart engagement through and beyond PlanTech.

T1  - Bruchus rufimanus Boh. Effect on Broad Bean Seed Quality and the Infection Level of Seed-Borne Fungal Pathogens
AN  - 2812735639
AB  - Broad bean weevil (Bruchus rufimanus Boh.) is considered an economically important insect pest of the broad bean crop. Its damage starts when larvae burrow into the seed and feed on endosperm or kill the embryo, thus the seed cannot germinate. The microbiological quality and consumer safety of broad bean may be compromised by holes. This study was performed during 2018–2020 to estimate the effect of seed damage by B. rufimanus on seed quality, germination rate and seedling growth, and on the incidence of seed-borne fungal pathogens. Broad bean seeds were collected and classified as damaged by B. rufimanus or non-damaged. There was a relationship between broad bean weevil damage and an increase in fungal contamination. Results showed that germination decreased from 97.2% for non-damaged seeds to 81.4% for the seeds with B. rufimanus damage. Seven fungal genera were identified: Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp., Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., Mucor spp. and Botrytis spp. The most common fungal genus was Cladosporium spp. Our research shows that B. rufimanus negatively affects the germination of its host’s seeds and decreases the development of seedlings.

T1  - Optimizing Insecticide Application Timing for Broad Bean Weevil Control and Minimizing Crop Damage in Broad Bean (Vicia faba Linn.)
AN  - 2812658319
AB  - During the growing seasons of 2018 to 2020, a field experiment in broad bean (Vicia faba L.) was conducted at the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. The objective of the study was to explore the effects of the timing of insecticide application on the abundance, damage, and control of the broad bean weevil (Bruchus rufimanus Boh.). The experiment included four spray regimes and an untreated control. Yellow water traps were utilized to monitor the broad bean weevil from germination to senescence. Results indicate that broad bean weevil infestation occurred in all study years, with the highest density of adults observed during the flowering stage. Damage to seeds ranged from 23% to 59.62%. The data suggest that B. rufimanus infestation can result in a 19.1% reduction in seed yield. However, spraying when the daily temperature exceeded the threshold for adult activity for 3 days and at the end of flowering produced a significant increase in yield of 13.3% and 6.6%, respectively. Additionally, the spray at the end of flowering reduced damaged seeds by 21.4–48%.

T1  - Constraints on long-term cliff retreat and intertidal weathering at weak rock coasts using cosmogenic 10Be, nearshore topography and numerical modelling
AN  - 2811449694
AB  - The white chalk cliffs on the south coast of England are one of the most iconic coastlines in the world. Rock coasts located in a weak lithology, such as chalk, are likely to be most vulnerable to climate-change-triggered accelerations in cliff retreat rates. In order to make future forecasts of cliff retreat rates as a response to climate change, we need to look beyond individual erosion events to quantify the long-term trends in cliff retreat rates. Exposure dating of shore platforms using cosmogenic radionuclide analysis and numerical modelling allows us to study past cliff retreat rates across the Late Holocene for these chalk coastlines. Here, we conduct a multi-objective optimisation of a coastal evolution model to both high-precision topographic data and 10Be concentrations at four chalk rock coast sites to reveal a link between cliff retreat rates and the rate of sea-level rise. Furthermore, our results strengthen evidence for a recent acceleration in cliff retreat rates at the chalk cliffs on the south coast of England. Our optimised model results suggest that the relatively rapid historical cliff retreat rates observed at these sites spanning the last 150 years last occurred between 5300 and 6800 years ago when the rate of relative sea-level rise was a factor of 5–9 times more rapid than during the recent observable record. However, results for these chalk sites also indicate that current process-based models of rock coast development are overlooking key processes that were not previously identified at sandstone rock coast sites. Interpretation of results suggest that beaches, cliff debris and heterogenous lithology play an important but poorly understood role in the long-term evolution of these chalk rock coast sites. Despite these limitations, our results reveal significant differences in intertidal weathering rates between sandstone and chalk rock coast sites, which helps to inform the long-standing debate of “wave versus weathering” as the primary control on shore platform development. At the sandstone sites, subaerial weathering has been negligible during the Holocene. In contrast, for the chalk sites, intertidal weathering plays an active role in the long-term development of the shore platform and cliff system. Overall, our results demonstrate how an abstract, process-based model, when optimised with a rigorous optimisation routine, can not only capture long-term trends in transient cliff retreat rates but also distinguish key erosion processes active in millennial-scale rock coast evolution at real-world sites with contrasting rock types.

T1  - Environmental impact of cardiovascular healthcare
AN  - 2808313504
AB  - ImportanceThe healthcare sector is essential to human health and well-being, yet its significant carbon footprint contributes to climate change-related threats to health.ObjectiveTo review systematically published studies on environmental impacts, including carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, of contemporary cardiovascular healthcare of all types, from prevention through to treatment.Evidence reviewWe followed the methods of systematic review and synthesis. We conducted searches in Medline, EMBASE and Scopus for primary studies and systematic reviews measuring environmental impacts of any type of cardiovascular healthcare published in 2011 and onwards. Studies were screened, selected and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Studies were too heterogeneous for pooling in meta-analysis and were narratively synthesised with insights derived from content analysis.FindingsA total of 12 studies estimating environmental impacts, including carbon emissions (8 studies), of cardiac imaging, pacemaker monitoring, pharmaceutical prescribing and in-hospital care including cardiac surgery were found. Of these, three studies used the gold-standard method of Life Cycle Assessment. One of these found the environmental impact of echocardiography was 1%–20% that of cardiac MR (CMR) imaging and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) scanning. Many opportunities to reduce environmental impacts were identified: carbon emissions can be reduced by choosing echocardiography as the first cardiac test before considering CT or CMR, remote monitoring of pacemaker devices and teleconsultations when clinically appropriate to do so. Several interventions may be effective for reducing waste, including rinsing bypass circuitry after cardiac surgery. Cobenefits included reduced costs, health benefits such as cell salvage blood available for perfusion, and social benefits such as reduced time away from work for patients and carers. Content analysis revealed concern about the environmental impact of cardiovascular healthcare, particularly carbon emissions and a desire for change.Conclusions and relevanceCardiac imaging, pharmaceutical prescribing and in-hospital care including cardiac surgery have significant environmental impacts, including CO2e emissions which contribute to climate-related threats to human health. Importantly, many opportunities to effectively reduce environmental impacts exist within cardiac care, and can provide economic, health and social cobenefits.

T1  - Reflecting on Climate Change Education Priorities in Secondary Schools in England: Moving beyond Learning about Climate Change to the Emotions of Living with Climate Change
AN  - 2806604773
AB  - Schools in England remain a valued and important site of climate change education for secondary school pupils (aged 11–18 years). Drawing on focus group data (n = 85) from young people based in eight schools in England, we explored the language pupils used about climate change. We found that young people’s responses to climate change were predominantly focused on content knowledge about climate change, including the concept of global warming and a range of negative impacts, such as biodiversity and habitat loss and extreme and unpredictable weather. In addition, the young people expressed emotions in relation to climate change that were primarily negative and were focused on fear of the future and fear of frustrated youth action. We highlight that school-based climate change education requires support and resources from policy-makers so that young people do not solely learn about climate change, but rather, they are able to live with the emotions of a future shaped by the impacts of climate change. We highlight the need for teacher professional development which enables them to respond to the emotions young people experience in the context of climate change education.

T1  - The Nutritional Quality of Food Provision at UK Government-Funded Holiday Clubs: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Energy and Nutrient Content
AN  - 2806590841
AB  - A large proportion of children are at risk of food insecurity during school holidays in the UK. The government-funded Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) programme provides free holiday clubs offering at least one healthy meal/day to eligible children and adolescents. This study aims at evaluating the nutritional quality of food provision at HAF holiday clubs, particularly hot/cold and vegetarian/non-vegetarian meals. Menu variants (n = 2759) from 49 HAF holiday clubs were assessed for adherence to School Food Standards (SFS) and their notional compositional quality, which was scored utilising a novel nutrient-based meal quality index. The median adherence to SFS across all available menus was 70% (IQR 59–79%). Overall, hot variants scored statistically higher menu quality scores than cold variants for both 5–11y (92.3 (80.7–102.7) vs. 80.4 (69.3–90.6)) and 11–18y (73.5 (62.5–85.8) vs. 58.9 (50.0–70.7)) criteria. Cold and hot menu variants tended to score differentially for quality sub-components. These findings highlight areas for potential future improvement in HAF holiday club provision with a tendency for food provision to appear less ideal for attendees for those aged 11–18. Ensuring that children from low-income households have access to a healthy diet is crucial to reduce UK health inequalities.

T1  - Multi-Technique Approach for Work Function Exploration of Sc2O3 Thin Films
AN  - 2806590575
AB  - Thin films based on scandium oxide (Sc2O3) were deposited on silicon substrates to investigate the thickness effect on the reduction of work function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray reflectivity (EDXR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on the films deposited by electron-beam evaporation with different nominal thicknesses (in the range of 2–50 nm) and in multi-layered mixed structures with barium fluoride (BaF2) films. The obtained results indicate that non-continuous films are required to minimize the work function (down to 2.7 eV at room temperature), thanks to the formation of surface dipole effects between crystalline islands and substrates, even if the stoichiometry is far from the ideal one (Sc/O = 0.38). Finally, the presence of BaF2 in multi-layered films is not beneficial for a further reduction in the work function.

T1  - Disturbance and Succession in Early to Mid-Holocene Northern English Forests: Palaeoecological Evidence for Disturbance of Woodland Ecosystems by Mesolithic Hunter-Gatherers
AN  - 2806541796
AB  - Forest succession can be monitored in the present, modelled for the future, but also reconstructed in the past on the records of forest history, including through the use of palaeo-ecological techniques. Longer-term records from pollen data can show changes over centennial and millennial timescales that are impacted by climate, migration or soil development. Having knowledge of previous phases of post-disturbance seral stages of woodland regeneration however, as after fire, can provide insights regarding successional process and function over short-term decadal timescales. The aim of this paper is to test the high-resolution pollen record as a source of new insights into processes of succession, assisted by the supplementary data of microscopic charcoal analyses. On short-term timescales, multiple phases of forest disturbance and then recovery have been identified in early to mid-Holocene peat records in northern England, many from the uplands but also from lowland areas. We identify and describe a typology of recovery patterns, including the composition and rate of recovery, and then test the processes and factors that impacted on different seral trajectories, concentrating on fire disturbance which might have had a natural origin, or might have been caused by pre-agricultural Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Factors considered include the spatial location and intensity of the fire event, the duration of the disturbance phase, the structure and dynamics of the successional regeneration vegetation communities and the pre-disturbance tree cover. Data from examples of fire disturbance of woodland have been examined from both upland and lowland sites in northern England and indicate that they had different successional pathways after disturbance. Fire disturbances in the denser lowland forests were mostly single burn events followed by natural successions and regeneration to forest, whereas fire disturbances in the upland woods usually showed continued or repetitive fire pressure after the initial burning, arresting succession so that vegetation was maintained in a shrub phase, often dominated by Corylus, for an extended period of time until disturbance ceased. This creation of a kind of prolonged, almost plagioclimax, ‘fire-coppice’ hazel stage suggests controlled rather than natural successional pathways, and strongly suggests that Mesolithic foragers were the fire starters in the upland English woodlands where hazel was naturally common and could be maintained in abundance in later-stage successions, along with other edible plants, for human use. All post-fire seral stages would have been attractive to game animals, providing a reliable food source that would have been of great benefit to hunter-gatherer populations.

T1  - Assessing the Economic Impact of Introducing Localised PV Solar Energy Generation and Energy Storage for Fleet Electrification
AN  - 2806539798
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector and their effect on air quality are now a major concern, and the electrification of road freight transport is seen as one potential solution. However, this presents a challenge with the increased electricity demand on a depot’s grid connection, and increased costs if this has to be upgraded. This study seeks to evaluate the impact on costs of introducing solar (PV) panels and a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) when a company electrifies its fleet, based on two different priorities. On one hand, avoiding the use of the grid at peak price periods at the expense of upgrading the power connection. On the other hand, avoiding any power connection upgrade at the expense of incurring excess capacity charges. These two priorities aim to represent real-life challenges that logistics and commercial companies are facing when it comes to fleet electrification. The choice of prioritising one over the other may be driven by operational requirements and/or technical constraints. For each approach, a different energy management algorithm is developed using MATLAB and Simulink. The results obtained suggest that there is more flexibility in cost reduction when the upgrade of the power connection is not an obstacle. If the upgrade of the power network is not an option, the installation of PV panels and a BESS must be implemented together with other strategies (i.e., smart charging) to make it an economic option.

T1  - Assessing the Performance of Small Wind Energy Systems Using Regional Weather Data
AN  - 2806517803
AB  - While large renewable power generation schemes, such as wind farms, are well monitored with a wealth of data provided through a SCADA system, the only information about the behaviour of small wind turbines is often only through the metered electricity production. Given the variability of electricity output in response to the local wind or radiation condition, it is difficult to ascertain whether particular electricity production in a metering period is the result of the system operating normally or if a fault is resulting in a sub-optimal production. This paper develops two alternative methods to determine a performance score based only on electricity production and proxy wind data obtained from the nearest available weather measurement. One method based on partitioning the data, consistent with a priori expectations of turbine performance, performs well in common wind conditions but struggles to reflect the effects of different wind directions. An alternative method based on Principal Component Analysis is less intuitive but shown to be able to incorporate wind direction.

T1  - Evaluating Groundwater Nitrate Status across the River Ythan Catchment (Scotland) following Two Decades of Nitrate Vulnerable Zone Designation
AN  - 2806516534
AB  - Diffuse agricultural pollution is one of the greatest challenges to achieving good chemical and ecological status of Scotland’s water bodies. The River Ythan in Aberdeenshire was designated a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in the year 2000, due to the eutrophication of the Ythan Estuary and rising nitrate trends in Private Water Supply (PWS) groundwater abstractions. The third River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) for Scotland reported the Ellon groundwater body of the River Ythan catchment to be of poor chemical status as of 2021 with respect to nitrate, and forecasted groundwater recovery beyond 2027. Following two decades of NVZ designation, we investigated the drivers of groundwater nitrate across the River Ythan catchment through an analysis of long-term (2009–2018) groundwater quality monitoring data collected by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and a recent synoptic groundwater nitrate sampling survey of PWSs. Groundwater nitrate was found to remain elevated across the catchment area, and appeared to be highly sensitive to agricultural practices and meteorological forcing, indicating a high sensitivity of groundwater quality to environmental change. Further hydrogeological characterisation is recommended to better understand the effects of agricultural practices on groundwater quality, and to facilitate achievement of future RBMP goals under a changing climate.

T1  - Quantifying Invasive Pest Dynamics through Inference of a Two-Node Epidemic Network Model
AN  - 2806506975
AB  - Invasive woodland pests have substantial ecological, economic, and social impacts, harming biodiversity and ecosystem services. Mathematical modelling informed by Bayesian inference can deepen our understanding of the fundamental behaviours of invasive pests and provide predictive tools for forecasting future spread. A key invasive pest of concern in the UK is the oak processionary moth (OPM). OPM was established in the UK in 2006; it is harmful to both oak trees and humans, and its infestation area is continually expanding. Here, we use a computational inference scheme to estimate the parameters for a two-node network epidemic model to describe the temporal dynamics of OPM in two geographically neighbouring parks (Bushy Park and Richmond Park, London). We show the applicability of such a network model to describing invasive pest dynamics and our results suggest that the infestation within Richmond Park has largely driven the infestation within Bushy Park.

T1  - The Politics and Aesthetic Choices of Feminist Art Criticism
AN  - 2806463630
AB  - This article explores feminist art criticism from the point of view of aesthetics/politics in global contemporary art. It is based on the author’s experience as an art critic and founding editor of n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal (1998–2017). Reading articles published in the previous two decades both for the journal and outside it, it became possible to identify how subjects produce specific objects in art criticism that demonstrate different locations and standpoints in thought and how these align with criticism from broader feminist political theories. This is an exploration of the aesthetics/politics both in, about and beyond feminist art criticism. The methodology presented analyses feminist art criticism using a model of clusters of concepts that draws on Anne Ring Petersen’s examination of identity politics, race and multiculturalism from 2012. Feminist analyses in which this approach has been attempted are discussed: Sue Rosser’s 2005 analysis of cyberfeminism and Tuzyline Jita Allan’s 1995 discussion of black/womanist/African feminisms. The article identifies four types of feminist art criticism: liberal feminism, materialist feminism, feminist cosmopolitan multi-culturalism, and queer post-colonial feminism. The aims, methods and approaches of these tendencies are outlined to demonstrate the differences between them. The article concludes with a discussion about the futures of feminist art criticism.

T1  - Improving Antimicrobial Use to Protect the Environment: What Is the Role of Infection Specialists?
AN  - 2806456073
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental changes are causing severe damage to the natural and social systems on which human health depends. The environmental impacts of the manufacture, use, and disposal of antimicrobials cannot be underestimated. This article explores the meaning of environmental sustainability and four sustainability principles (prevention, patient engagement, lean service delivery, and low carbon alternatives) that infection specialists can apply to support environmental sustainability in health systems. To prevent inappropriate use of antimicrobials and consequent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) requires international, national, and local surveillance plans and action supporting antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Engaging patients in addressing environmental sustainability, for example through public awareness campaigns about the appropriate disposal of unused and expired antimicrobials, could drive environmentally sustainable changes. Streamlining service delivery may include using innovative methods such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), or genotype-guided point of care testing (POCT) to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing and risk of adverse effects. Infection specialists can assess and advise on lower carbon alternatives such as choosing oral (PO) over intravenous (IV) antimicrobials where clinically appropriate. By applying sustainability principles, infection specialists can promote the effective use of healthcare resources, improve care quality, protect the environment, and prevent harm to current and future generations.

T1  - A Shortlisting Framework for Crop Diversification in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2806455252
AB  - We present a systematic framework for nationwide crop suitability assessment within the UK to improve the resilience in cropping systems and nutrition security of the UK population. An initial suitability analysis was performed using data from 1842 crops at 2862 grid locations within the UK, using climate (temperature and rainfall) and soil (pH, depth, and texture) data from the UK Met Office and British Geological Survey. In the second phase, additional qualitative and quantitative data are collected on 56 crops with the highest pedoclimatic suitability and coverage across the UK. An exercise was conducted on crops within each category using a systematic ranking methodology that shortlists crops with high value across a multitude of traits. Crops were ranked based on their nutritional value (macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals) and on adaptive (resistance to waterlogging/flood, frost, shade, pest, weed, and diseases and suitability in poor soils) and physiological traits (water-use efficiency and yield). Other characteristics such as the number of special uses, available germplasm through the number of institutions working on the crops, and production knowledge were considered in shortlisting. The shortlisted crops in each category are bulbous barley (cereal), colonial bentgrass (fodder), Russian wildrye (forage), sea buckthorn (fruit), blue lupin (legume), shoestring acacia (nut), ochrus vetch (vegetable), spear wattle (industrial), scallion (medicinal), and velvet bentgrass (ornamental/landscape). These crops were identified as suitable crops that can be adopted in the UK. We further discuss steps in mainstreaming these and other potential crops based on a systematic framework that takes into account local farming system issues, land suitability, and crop performance modelling at the field scale across the UK.

T1  - Reducing the carbon footprint of research: experience from the NightLife study
AN  - 2805239800
AB  - BackgroundAs set out in the Climate Change Act (2008), the UK National Health Service (NHS) has made a commitment to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and reach net zero by 2050. Research forms a core part of NHS activity and reducing the carbon footprint of clinical trials is a core element of the National Institute for Health and Care Research Carbon Reduction Strategy (2019).Key argumentsHowever, support from funding organisations on how to achieve these targets is lacking. This brief communication article reports the reduction in the carbon footprint of the NightLife study, an ongoing multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of in-centre nocturnal haemodialysis on quality of life.ConclusionBy using remote conferencing software and innovative data collection methods, we demonstrated a total saving of 136 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over three workstreams during the first 18 months of the study, following grant activation on 1 January 2020. In addition to the environmental impact, there were additional benefits seen to cost as well as increased participant diversity and inclusion. This work highlights ways in which trials could be made less carbon intensive, more environmentally sustainable and better value for money.

T1  - Climate Change Attitudes, Relationship To Nature And Pro-Environmental Behaviour Of Students From Three European Countries
AN  - 2804690775
AB  - Climate change is not a future problem, it is a significant variation of weather conditions becoming warmer, wetter or drier. It is the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability. The aim of this research was to determine primary school students’ knowledge and attitudes related to climate change among primary school students (n = 473) in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Portugal using a questionnaire survey. The dimensions of climate change knowledge, environmental attitudes and values, pro-environmental behaviour, and climate change attitudes were measured and analysed. The results showed gender differences in favour of girls in all the dimensions studied, except for climate change knowledge, where the results of boys and girls were comparable. In an international comparison, UK children scored higher on climate change knowledge and climate change attitudes dimensions. A multiple regression analysis showed the dimensions of nature preservation and appreciation of nature as the strongest positive predictors of pro-environmental behaviour and the dimensions of climate change knowledge and nature preservation as the strongest predictors of climate change belief. The results suggest the importance and implications of the wider societal debate on climate-related personal dimensions. The interconnectedness of environmental and climate-related topics at the primary school level is also evident.

AN  - 2804686668
AB  - What does it mean to think of chemicals as kin? Building on the concepts of chemical kinships and pollution as colonialism, I use a feminist storytelling methodology grounded in relational ontology to explore my kinship relationships with reactive nitrogen, and the way it both hurts me and gives me life. Agriculture and organic chemistry are close kin to imperialism, capitalism, and environmental destruction, and, as a white British woman, I argue these are also my own more-than-human family: my close kin. To take the call to kinship seriously, I argue for approaching kinship personally, and accepting clear positionality in relation: exploring my relation to how these kin both abuse and support me, our ancestral entanglement, and my own complicity and responsibility in enabling their abuse.

T1  - Research-by-Design in Complex Systems: Reflections on Approaches Used to Reimagine Environmentally Sustainable, High-Welfare Poultry Housing Futures
AN  - 2799808144
AB  - Despite projected global rises in chicken consumption, growing environmental and welfare challenges threaten the future of commercial poultry production. Though some of these challenges, such as biosecurity, sourcing, pollution, and waste, have been thoroughly researched, the open-ended, complex, and interrelated nature of the sector means that it is difficult for poultry producers to know how to change. Design may offer a new way to analyse and reframe these challenges, to speculate on a range of different solutions for these complex systems of production. This paper reflects on the research-by-design methods applied to reimagine environmentally sustainable, high-welfare poultry housing futures. The paper is based on an eighteen-month long, multidisciplinary research project with a large U.K.-based poultry farming integrator, a poultry house ventilation and equipment supplier, and academic partners with expertise in research-by-design and bird welfare. After contextualising challenges faced by the poultry sector, the paper outlines a three-step, iterative approach within which design methods were applied, beginning with (1) a baseline analysis of farm inputs, outputs, actors, and networks, and then (2) a consolidation of themes and scenarios, leading to the development of (3) a compendium of ideas for the future of poultry farming. The Results section presents three design propositions, each imagining different futures by recreating the farm as a system of “closed-loop” flows, reframing the “chicken as client” and challenging current centralised models of production to connect consumers to food provenance and impact. These propositions function as vehicles to test design methods, such as designing for resource flows challenging actor hierarchies and hacking stakeholder networks. While some interesting ideas are presented, the paper highlights the complexity of the challenge and reflects on the value of design to reframe these challenges to collaboratively foster new perspectives and mindsets.

T1  - New Conceptual Model of Social Sustainability: Review from Past Concepts and Ideas
AN  - 2799623477
AB  - The social dimension of sustainability has remained relatively underdefined, despite the efforts to specify and integrate this dimension into the general sustainability conversation of scholars and practitioners. This study aims to advance the conversation of social sustainability by examining past the multi-disciplinary literature and policy documents, as well as proposing a comprehensive conceptual model of social sustainability. We present a model with five dimensions: safety and security, equity, adaptability, social inclusion and cohesion, and quality of life. Through these dimensions, we propose social sustainability as a process that strives for effective management and allocation of social capital as a constitutive resource, and the confrontation of such controllable and uncontrollable risks as natural disasters and climate change. Our model was constructed with the purpose of providing scholars, policymakers, and practitioners with a comprehensive guideline to create social sustainability policy with human beings as the priority and cultural awareness as a grounding approach to initiating disaster-related and climate-change resilience.

T1  - The Contribution of Environmental Science to Mental Health Research: A Scoping Review
AN  - 2799621229
AB  - Mental health is influenced by multiple complex and interacting genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors. As such, developing state-of-the-art mental health knowledge requires collaboration across academic disciplines, including environmental science. To assess the current contribution of environmental science to this field, a scoping review of the literature on environmental influences on mental health (including conditions of cognitive development and decline) was conducted. The review protocol was developed in consultation with experts working across mental health and environmental science. The scoping review included 202 English-language papers, published between 2010 and 2020 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), on environmental themes that had not already been the subject of recent systematic reviews; 26 reviews on climate change, flooding, air pollution, and urban green space were additionally considered. Studies largely focused on populations in the USA, China, or Europe and involved limited environmental science input. Environmental science research methods are primarily focused on quantitative approaches utilising secondary datasets or field data. Mental health measurement was dominated by the use of self-report psychometric scales. Measures of environmental states or exposures were often lacking in specificity (e.g., limited to the presence or absence of an environmental state). Based on the scoping review findings and our synthesis of the recent reviews, a research agenda for environmental science’s future contribution to mental health scholarship is set out. This includes recommendations to expand the geographical scope and broaden the representation of different environmental science areas, improve measurement of environmental exposure, prioritise experimental and longitudinal research designs, and giving greater consideration to variation between and within communities and the mediating pathways by which environment influences mental health. There is also considerable opportunity to increase interdisciplinarity within the field via the integration of conceptual models, the inclusion of mixed methods and qualitative approaches, as well as further consideration of the socio-political context and the environmental states that can help support good mental health. The findings were used to propose a conceptual model to parse contributions and connections between environmental science and mental health to inform future studies.

T1  - A Novel Scheme to Allocate the Green Energy Transportation Costs—Application to Carbon Captured and Hydrogen
AN  - 2799616416
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) are essential energy vectors in the green energy transition. H2 is a fuel produced by electrolysis and is applied in heavy transportation where electrification is not feasible yet. The pollutant substance CO2 is starting to be captured and stored in different European locations. In Denmark, the energy vision aims to use this CO2 to be reacted with H2, producing green methanol. Typically, the production units are not co-located with consumers and thus, the required transportation infrastructure is essential for meeting supply and demand. This work presents a novel scheme to allocate the transportation costs of CO2 and H2 in pipeline networks, which can be applied to any network topology and with any allocation method. During the tariff formation process, coordinated adjustments are made by the novel scheme on the original tariffs produced by the allocation method employed, considering the location of each customer connected to pipeline network. Locational tariffs are provided as result, and the total revenue recovery is guaranteed to the network owner. Considering active customers, the novel scheme will lead to a decrease of distant pipeline flows, thereby contributing to the prevention of bottlenecks in the transportation network. Thus, structural reinforcements can be avoided, reducing the total transportation cost paid by all customers in the long-term.

T1  - Enhancing User Engagement in Local Energy Initiatives Using Smart Local Energy Engagement Tools: A Meta Study
AN  - 2799614198
AB  - Deploying smart local energy engagement tools (SLEETs) in local energy projects enables users to better observe and control energy, and potentially become active participants in local energy management. Using a cross-project approach, this paper examines the prevalence, effectiveness and inclusiveness of 84 SLEETs deployed in 72 local energy projects in the UK from 2008 to 2018. An original framework for the characterisation of SLEETs was employed, which grouped them into seven types and characterised them in terms of their level of interaction and interface design. Our study shows that information-driven tools were the most popular in community energy groups, while digital energy platforms or interaction tools with numeric interfaces were the most popular in smart local energy system (SLES) initiatives. In contrast, interaction tools with visual interfaces, and tools offering control were found to be less popular. Spatial analysis revealed that SLEETs were mostly deployed in areas with grid constraints (technology), active community energy groups (people) and engaged local authorities (policy). Effective SLEETs were found to stimulate engagement amongst people (social engagement), and between people and technology (operation and control), while inclusive SLEETs enabled the inclusion of vulnerable and low-income households. The acceptance and implementation of SLES initiatives can be enhanced by creating effective and inclusive SLEETs that align with local users’ requirements and are supported by local stakeholders in order to foster trust. In future, there is a need to develop appropriate metrics (key performance indicator) or scoring methods to measure the prevalence, effectiveness, and inclusiveness of SLEETs in a consistent manner.

T1  - Investigating the Factors That Determine the ESG Disclosure Practices in Europe
AN  - 2791744801
AB  - The increased focus on environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) (ESG) disclosure has become a necessary step toward the integration of sustainability practices into firms’ culture to meet the expectations of stakeholders. The social and environmental implications of firm activities on the environment and surrounding communities have led to the growing demand for useful non-financial information. This paper investigates the impacts of the board’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy and CSR orientation, GRI, and the country–cultural dimensions, based on Hofstede’s measures of ESG disclosure practices within Europe. Using a European dataset from Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon, this paper adopts a quantitative research methodology to test the research hypotheses through a statistical analysis of 7840 observations from European companies to analyze the extent of the relationship between micro- and macro-variables and the disclosure of company ESG. Our findings suggest that both board CSR orientation and strategy and the GRI have positively and significantly affected the overall disclosure of ESG practices within Europe. When examining country–cultural dimensions, we find that individualism and feminine cultures are positively associated with increased levels of ESG disclosure. Our findings shed light on factors affecting ESG disclosure practices within Europe and could be of interest to companies, policy makers, and other stakeholders.

T1  - Prioritising Climate Change Mitigation Behaviours and Exploring Public Health Co-Benefits: A Delphi Study
AN  - 2791654252
AB  - Climate change requires urgent action; however, it can be challenging to identify individual-level behaviours that should be prioritised for maximum impact. The study aimed to prioritise climate change mitigation behaviours according to their impacts on climate change and public health, and to identify associated barriers and facilitators—exploring the impact of observed behaviour shifts associated with COVID-19 in the UK. A three-round Delphi study and expert workshop were conducted: An expert panel rated mitigation behaviours impacted by COVID-19 in relation to their importance regarding health impacts and climate change mitigation using a five-point Likert scale. Consensus on the importance of target behaviours was determined by interquartile ranges. In total, seven target behaviours were prioritised: installing double/triple glazing; installing cavity wall insulation; installing solid wall insulation; moving away from meat/emission heavy diets; reducing the number of cars per household; walking shorter journeys; and reducing day/weekend leisure car journeys. Barriers related to the costs associated with performing behaviours and a lack of complementary policy-regulated subsidies. The target behaviours are consistent with recommendations from previous research. To ensure public uptake, interventions should address behavioural facilitators and barriers, dovetail climate change mitigation with health co-benefits and account for the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on these behaviours.

T1  - Investigating the Influence of Groundwater Flow and Charge Cycle Duration on Deep Borehole Heat Exchangers for Heat Extraction and Borehole Thermal Energy Storage
AN  - 2791650645
AB  - Decarbonisation of heat is essential to meeting net zero carbon targets; however, fluctuating renewable resources, such as wind or solar, may not meet peak periods of demand. Therefore, methods of underground thermal energy storage can aid in storing heat in low demand periods to be exploited when required. Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) is an important technology in storing surplus heat and the efficiency of such systems can be strongly influenced by groundwater flow. In this paper, the effect of groundwater flow on a single deep borehole heat exchanger (DBHEs) was modelled using OpenGeoSys (OGS) software to test the impact of varying regional Darcy velocities on the performance of heat extraction and BTES. It is anticipated that infrastructure such as ex-geothermal exploration or oil and gas development wells approaching the end of life could be repurposed. These systems may encounter fluid flow in the subsurface and the impact of this on single well deep BTES has not previously been investigated. Higher groundwater velocities can increase the performance of a DBHE operating to extract heat only for a heating season of 6 months. This is due to the reduced cooling of rocks in proximity to the DBHE as groundwater flow replenishes heat which has been removed from the rock volume around the borehole (this can also be equivalently thought of as “coolth” being transported away from the DBHE in a thermal plume). When testing varying Darcy velocities with other parameters for a DBHE of 920 m length in rock of thermal conductivity 2.55 W/(m·K), it was observed that rocks with larger Darcy velocity (1e-6 m/s) can increase the thermal output by up to 28 kW in comparison to when there is no groundwater flow. In contrast, groundwater flow inhibits single well deep BTES as it depletes the thermal store, reducing storage efficiency by up to 13% in comparison to models with no advective heat transfer in the subsurface. The highest Darcy velocity of 1e-6 m/s was shown to most influence heat extraction and BTES; however, the likelihood of this occurring regionally, and at depth of around or over 1 km is unlikely. This study also tested varying temporal resolutions of charge and cyclicity. Shorter charge periods allow a greater recovery of heat (c. 34% heat injected recovered for 1 month charge, as opposed to <17% for 6 months charge).

T1  - Breeding Bread-Making Wheat Varieties for Organic Farming Systems: The Need to Target Productivity, Robustness, Resource Use Efficiency and Grain Quality Traits
AN  - 2791646704
AB  - Agronomic protocols (rotation, tillage, fertilization and crop protection) commonly used in organic and conventional crop production differ significantly and there is evidence that modern varieties developed for conventional high-input farming systems do not have the combination of traits required for optimum performance in organic farming systems. Specifically, there is evidence that prohibition on the use of water-soluble, mineral N, P and K fertilizers and synthetic pesticide inputs in organic farming results in a need to revise both breeding and selection protocols. For organic production systems, the focus needs to be on the following: (i) traits prioritized by organic farmers such as high nutrient use efficiency from organic fertilizer inputs, competitiveness against weeds, and pest and disease resistance, (ii) processing quality parameters defined by millers and bakers and (iii) nutritional quality parameters demanded by organic consumers. In this article, we review evidence from variety trials and factorial field experiments that (i) studied to what extent there is a need for organic farming focused breeding programs, (ii) investigated which traits/trait combinations should be targeted in these breeding programs and/or (iii) compared the performance of modern varieties developed for the conventional sector with traditional/older varieties favored by organic farmers and/or new varieties developed in organic farming focused breeding programs. Our review focuses on wheat because there have been organic and/or low-input farming focused wheat breeding programs for more than 20 years in Europe, which has allowed the performance of varieties/genotypes from organic/low-input and conventional farming focused breeding programs to be compared.

T1  - Impacts of Prefabrication in the Building Construction Industry
AN  - 2791603762
AB  - DefinitionInterest in sustainable construction has been increasing due to recent events. The limitations of natural resources and the scale of global impacts, specifically as a result of the effects of global climate change, have consequences for the construction sector. These changes are giving rise to a need to reassess the way we face the built environment and rethink new solutions for construction systems or methods that contribute to mitigating negative consequences, among which we highlight the prefabrication method. This new scenario, characterised by the need to meet the decarbonisation goals set for 2050, as well as the effects of the spread of the pandemic crisis, emphasizes the importance of understanding the impacts that may occur in the construction industry, which are essentially understood as increases in sustainability, productivity, quality and, consequently, as reductions in deadlines, costs, and dependence on labour. Therefore, this entry seeks to study on the existing literature on prefabrication, seeking to gather relevant information on the new advances, challenges, and opportunities of this construction method whose approach has been mostly focused on partial or specific aspects for case studies, both highlighting the potential and identifying the gaps and opportunities of prefabrication in this new context. The prefabrication method brings benefits compared to the conventional method, and may be an alternative, as it has more positive global impacts on the environment, the economy, and society, and consequently on the sustainable development of construction, despite some limitations that have been reported and that should be looked into in the future.

T1  - Exploring Leaders’ Perceptions of the Business Case for Digitalisation in the Construction Industry
AN  - 2791600306
AB  - For decision-makers in construction organisations, it is imperative that persuasive business cases are formulated on matters of digital transformation. In fact, a link has been established between the low adoption of digitalisation in construction organisations and poor business case formation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the cues that may facilitate the development of such a business case responsible for wider adoption. (1) Methodology: We utilised a purposive sampling method to gather qualitative data from 19 leaders of UK construction organisations. Analysis of the semi-structured interviews involves a thematic analysis through an inductive approach. (2) Findings: Overall, this exploration led to the emergence of nine themes, informing research on aspects that may contribute to substantiating a compelling business case behind the broader use of digitalisation in construction firms. The findings suggest that embracing such arguments would enable digital advocates to craft compelling arguments that may persuade decision-makers towards digitalisation. (3) Originality: This is the first paper in the construction domain to explore how building a robust business case that can justify adoption, offering digital advocates a set of cues that can be used to develop a successful relational capability to advance with their digital agendas. Thus, this study is a unique contribution to the literature, offering evidence that is otherwise understudied in the construction context.

T1  - Healthy Cities, A comprehensive dataset for environmental determinants of health in England cities
AN  - 2790695062
AB  - This paper presents a fine-grained and multi-sourced dataset for environmental determinants of health collected from England cities. We provide health outcomes of citizens covering physical health (COVID-19 cases, asthma medication expenditure, etc.), mental health (psychological medication expenditure), and life expectancy estimations. We present the corresponding environmental determinants from four perspectives, including basic statistics (population, area, etc.), behavioural environment (availability of tobacco, health-care services, etc.), built environment (road density, street view features, etc.), and natural environment (air quality, temperature, etc.). To reveal regional differences, we extract and integrate massive environment and health indicators from heterogeneous sources into two unified spatial scales, i.e., at the middle layer super output area (MSOA) and the city level, via big data processing and deep learning. Our data holds great promise for diverse audiences, such as public health researchers and urban designers, to further unveil the environmental determinants of health and design methodology for a healthy, sustainable city.

T1  - Simulating flexibility, variability and decentralisation with an integrated energy system model for Great Britain
AN  - 2789896821
AB  - Energy system models allow the development and assessment of ambitious transition pathways towards a sustainable energy system. However, current models lack adequate spatial and temporal resolution to capture the implications of a shift to decentralised energy supply and storage across multiple local energy vectors to meet spatially variable energy demand. There is also a lack of representation of interactions with the transport sector as well as national and local energy system operation. Here, we bridge these gaps with a high-resolution system-of-systems modelling framework which is applied to Great Britain to simulate differences between the performance of decarbonised energy systems in 2050 through two distinct strategies, an electric strategy and a multi-vector strategy prioritising a mix of fuels, including hydrogen. Within these strategies, we simulated the impacts of decentralised operation of the energy system given the variability of wind and across flexibility options including demand side management, battery storage and vehicle to grid services. Decentralised operation was shown to improve operational flexibility and maximise utilisation of renewables, whose electricity supplies can be cost-effectively converted to hydrogen or stored in batteries to meet peak electricity demands, therefore reducing carbon-intensive generation and the requirement for investment in expanding the electricity transmission network capacity.

T1  - The consolidated European synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions for the European Union and United Kingdom: 1990–2019
AN  - 2788734813
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and their temporal variability as well as flux attribution to natural and anthropogenic processes is essential to monitoring the progress in mitigating anthropogenic emissions under the Paris Agreement and to inform its global stocktake. This study provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions using bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) approaches for the European Union and UK (EU27 + UK) and updates earlier syntheses (Petrescu et al., 2020, 2021). The work integrates updated emission inventory data, process-based model results, data-driven sector model results and inverse modeling estimates, and it extends the previous period of 1990–2017 to 2019. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported by parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2021. Uncertainties in NGHGIs, as reported to the UNFCCC by the EU and its member states, are also included in the synthesis. Variations in estimates produced with other methods, such as atmospheric inversion models (TD) or spatially disaggregated inventory datasets (BU), arise from diverse sources including within-model uncertainty related to parameterization as well as structural differences between models. By comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, the activities included are a key source of bias between estimates, e.g., anthropogenic and natural fluxes, which in atmospheric inversions are sensitive to the prior geospatial distribution of emissions. For CH4 emissions, over the updated 2015–2019 period, which covers a sufficiently robust number of overlapping estimates, and most importantly the NGHGIs, the anthropogenic BU approaches are directly comparable, accounting for mean emissions of 20.5 Tg CH4 yr-1 (EDGARv6.0, last year 2018) and 18.4 Tg CH4 yr-1 (GAINS, last year 2015), close to the NGHGI estimates of 17.5±2.1 Tg CH4 yr-1. TD inversion estimates give higher emission estimates, as they also detect natural emissions. Over the same period, high-resolution regional TD inversions report a mean emission of 34 Tg CH4 yr-1. Coarser-resolution global-scale TD inversions result in emission estimates of 23 and 24 Tg CH4 yr-1 inferred from GOSAT and surface (SURF) network atmospheric measurements, respectively. The magnitude of natural peatland and mineral soil emissions from the JSBACH–HIMMELI model, natural rivers, lake and reservoir emissions, geological sources, and biomass burning together could account for the gap between NGHGI and inversions and account for 8 Tg CH4 yr-1. For N2O emissions, over the 2015–2019 period, both BU products (EDGARv6.0 and GAINS) report a mean value of anthropogenic emissions of 0.9 Tg N2O yr-1, close to the NGHGI data (0.8±55 % Tg N2O yr-1). Over the same period, the mean of TD global and regional inversions was 1.4 Tg N2O yr-1 (excluding TOMCAT, which reported no data). The TD and BU comparison method defined in this study can be operationalized for future annual updates for the calculation of CH4 and N2O budgets at the national and EU27 + UK scales. Future comparability will be enhanced with further steps involving analysis at finer temporal resolutions and estimation of emissions over intra-annual timescales, which is of great importance for CH4 and N2O, and may help identify sector contributions to divergence between prior and posterior estimates at the annual and/or inter-annual scale. Even if currently comparison between CH4 and N2O inversion estimates and NGHGIs is highly uncertain because of the large spread in the inversion results, TD inversions inferred from atmospheric observations represent the most independent data against which inventory totals can be compared. With anticipated improvements in atmospheric modeling and observations, as well as modeling of natural fluxes, TD inversions may arguably emerge as the most powerful tool for verifying emission inventories for CH4, N2O and other GHGs. The referenced datasets related to figures are visualized at 10.5281/zenodo.7553800 (Petrescu et al., 2023).

T1  - Experiences of Every Mind Matters, Public Health England’s adult mental health literacy campaign: a qualitative interview study
AN  - 2788466723
AB  - BackgroundEvery Mind Matters (EMM) is a publicly funded health campaign, launched in England in 2019, to equip adults to look after their mental health, and that of others, by offering online information about common problems: anxiety, low mood, sleep, and stress. This study is one component of an independent evaluation of EMM conducted by the NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit. Its aim is to explore individuals’ experiences of the EMM campaign and website.MethodsFour researchers, including three with lived experience of using mental health services, conducted 20, one-off, semi-structured, online interviews with a range of adult participants, including a sample of EMM users and a purposively recruited sub-sample known to have severe or long-term mental health conditions. A codebook thematic analysis was undertaken, and four main themes were identified.FindingsThere was an expectation from the name Every Mind Matters that its advice would address everyone. Almost all participants had experience of mental distress and looked to EMM for help with a current problem for themselves. All participants were complimentary about the EMM website and found it to be user-friendly (theme 1) and personalised (theme 2) especially the interactive feature Your Mind Plan quiz which responds with suggested actions to improve wellbeing and follows up with reminder emails. A few participants found the website information and/or Mind Plan suggestions to be life changing. Some participants wanted EMM to better acknowledge the contexts in which they live (theme 3) such as the limitations of health conditions and health services, and difficulties of crowded housing, social policy, and climate change. Many participants would like EMM to do more (theme 4), offer more interactivity, more choice, more information about available treatments, and more stratified advice to cover more severe mental health conditions.ConclusionEMM is available to all, including people with common or severe mental disorders. In the context of overwhelmed mental health services, people with severe mental illness expect more from EMM than advice about common problems. EMM could build on its success by extending its remit to address a wider range of needs so that everyone is included.

T1  - Projected changes in droughts and extreme droughts in Great Britain strongly influenced by the choice of drought index
AN  - 2787066091
AB  - Droughts cause enormous ecological, economical and societal damage, and they are already undergoing changes due to anthropogenic climate change. The issue of defining and quantifying droughts has long been a substantial source of uncertainty in understanding observed and projected trends. Atmosphere-based drought indicators, such as the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), are often used to quantify drought characteristics and their changes, sometimes as the sole metric representing drought. This study presents a detailed systematic analysis of SPI- and SPEI-based drought projections and their differences for Great Britain (GB), derived from the most recent set of regional climate projections for the United Kingdom (UK). We show that the choice of drought indicator has a decisive influence on the resulting projected changes in drought frequency, extent, duration and seasonality using scenarios that are 2 and 4 ∘C above pre-industrial levels. The projected increases in drought frequency and extent are far greater based on the SPEI than based on the SPI. Importantly, compared with droughts of all intensities, isolated extreme droughts are projected to increase far more with respect to frequency and extent and are also expected to show more pronounced changes in the distribution of their event durations. Further, projected intensification of the seasonal cycle is reflected in an increasing occurrence of years with (extremely) dry summers combined with wetter-than-average winters. Increasing summer droughts also form the main contribution to increases in annual droughts, especially using the SPEI. These results show that the choice of atmospheric drought index strongly influences the drought characteristics inferred from climate change projections, with a comparable impact to the uncertainty from the climate model parameters or the warming level; therefore, potential users of these indices should carefully consider the importance of potential evapotranspiration in their intended context. The stark differences between SPI- and SPEI-based projections highlight the need to better understand the interplay between increasing atmospheric evaporative demand, moisture availability and drought impacts under a changing climate. The region-dependent projected changes in drought characteristics by two warming levels have important implications for adaptation efforts in GB, and they further stress the need for rapid mitigation.

T1  - An Exploratory Study Examining the Key Aspects and Actions for Universities to Achieve High Sustainability Rankings
AN  - 2785245715
AB  - Understanding the concept of sustainability and its implementation in specific actions is necessary for today’s societies, and part of this responsibility falls on Higher Education Institutions. How these institutions have tried to address this issue has been diverse. To standardize, homogenize, and validate these sustainable practices, a few years ago, the University of Indonesia Green Metric positioned itself as the internationally accepted ranking; however, other rankings have begun to emerge, such as the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, which also addresses the search for compliance of the SDGs. For a novel or incipient university to establish the politics and actions to fulfill sustainability and SDGs or stay on track may represent a disorienting and challenging task, particularly when these rankings have different origins or criteria. So, this research aimed to review the top ten universities and their actions in the University of Indonesia Green Metric and Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, along with the organizational initiatives in education, to clarify the key measures and actions adopted by universities toward sustainability and their participation in the rankings, to pursue the SDGs related to social and environmental impacts in universities. Additionally, as a case study, we analyzed in detail the actions performed by the Tecnologico de Monterrey (located at the 274th and 100–200th places of the University of Indonesia Green Metric and the Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, respectively) and compared them with those of Top Ten Higher Education Institutions in both rankings. As a result, a summary guide of the actions is suggested to guide higher education institutions in adopting the required level of sustainability development indicated in the rankings.

T1  - Sustainable Outdoor Education: Organisations Connecting Children and Young People with Nature through the Arts
AN  - 2785240685
AB  - There is an increasing concern regarding the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people; as a result, schools are increasingly expected to provide support, but they have few resources to do so. As such, there is a need for establishing mechanisms for supporting the health and wellbeing of children and young people that are relatively easy and cost-effective and that can be embedded within the school day to ensure sustainability. The overarching aim of our Branching Out project was to understand how successful elements from one such programme that supports children’s mental health through the art-in-nature-based practice can be expanded from school-based approaches that reach small numbers of children to include whole communities. This paper reports on one strand that examined the practice of organisations offering arts and/or nature-based activities outdoors in schools, either as part of the curriculum or as an extra-curricular activity. Survey questions served as an a priori thematic framework around the characteristics of arts-in-nature activities delivered; the perceived impacts of activities; working with volunteers, teachers, and schools; and barriers to expansion and sustainability. Despite extensive searching, identifying, and recruiting relevant arts organisations was difficult; however, respondents strongly supported the notion that the arts-in-nature practice has a positive impact on children and young people’s connection to nature, supports their mental health and wellbeing, and engages them with their local environment. Yet, challenges were identified in engaging teachers and schools and funding such projects, suggesting a need for a multi-professional approach to creating more sustainable and impactful practice for children, young people, and communities.

T1  - Heatwaves, hospitals and health system resilience in England: a qualitative assessment of frontline perspectives from the hot summer of 2019
AN  - 2783805838
AB  - ObjectiveTo critically assess the impacts of very hot weather on (i) frontline staff in hospitals in England and (ii) on healthcare delivery and patient safety.Study designA qualitative study design using key informant semi-structured interviews, preinterview survey and thematic analysis.SettingEngland.Participants14 health professionals in the National Health Service (clinicians and non-clinicians, including facilities managers and emergency preparedness, resilience and response professionals).ResultsHot weather in 2019 caused significant disruption to health services, facilities and equipment, staff and patient discomfort, and an acute increase in hospital admissions. Levels of awareness varied between clinical and non-clinical staff of the Heatwave Plan for England, Heat-Health Alerts and associated guidance. Response to heatwaves was affected by competing priorities and tensions including infection control, electric fan usage and patient safety.ConclusionsHealthcare delivery staff experience difficulty in managing heat risks in hospitals. Priority should be given to workforce development and strategic, long-term planning, prevention and investment to enable staff to prepare and respond, as well as to improve health system resilience to current and future heat-health risks. Further research with a wider, larger cohort is required to develop the evidence base on the impacts, including the costs of those impacts, and to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of interventions. Forming a national picture of health system resilience to heatwaves will support national adaptation planning for health, in addition to informing strategic prevention and effective emergency response.

T1  - Greening the Audiovisual Sector: Towards a New Understanding through Innovation Practices in Wales and Beyond
AN  - 2779697560
AB  - Despite efforts towards reducing the negative environmental impact of the audiovisual sector, sustainability remains challenging. In this paper we address environmental sustainability in the Welsh audiovisual sector through the lens of green innovation. The mixed method study combines quantitative research measuring the adoption levels of green innovation inside businesses with qualitative analysis of selected case studies of green innovation. In doing so, the paper explores the extent of developing green innovation, as well as how research and development (R&D) as a specific roadmap to innovation leads to different forms of innovative outcomes. Based on this evidence, we propose an extended framework for considering green innovation in the audiovisual sector, one that differentiates between solution-driven, content-driven and mindset-driven innovation. By providing evidence of the extent and nature of green innovation in the audiovisual sector, the paper makes an important contribution to the underexplored field of green innovation research.

T1  - Biodiversity and the Recreational Value of Green Infrastructure in England
AN  - 2779656865
AB  - Green infrastructure refers to connected corridors of greenspaces within and beyond urban areas. It provides sustainable ecosystem goods and services for people and wildlife, enhancing their wellbeing and protecting them against climatic extremes. However, the exact contributing factors to the betterment of green infrastructure are not systematically examined at a national level. This study aims to identify what helps improve biodiversity and the recreational value of green infrastructure. The study uses hotspot analysis, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to understand the spatial patterns of the relevant variables and outcomes. Findings suggest that high wildlife species richness was reported in Forestry Commission woodlands and country parks, whilst doorstep greens and village greens returned poor species richness. The recreational value of greenspace was affected the most by certain types of greenspace (e.g., woodlands) as well as the percentage of urban cover. They indicate that biodiversity is generally high in areas away from urban centres, while access to greenspace in an urban space brings us high recreational value. These results indicate that green infrastructure is a complex system that requires the right balance between different priorities and services.

T1  - Life Cycle Cost Analysis for Scotland Short-Sea Ferries
AN  - 2779585429
AB  - The pathway to zero carbon emissions passing through carbon emissions reduction is mandatory in the shipping industry. Regarding the various methodologies and technologies reviewed for this purpose, Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) has been used as an excellent tool to determine economic feasibility and sustainability and to present directions. However, insufficient commercial applications cause a conflict of opinion on which fuel is the key to decarbonisation. Many LCCA comparison studies about eco-friendly ship propulsion claim different results. In order to overcome this and discover the key factors that affect the overall comparative analysis and results in the maritime field, it is necessary to conduct the comparative analysis considering more diverse case ships, case routes, and various types that combine each system. This study aims to analyse which greener fuels are most economically beneficial for the shipping sector and prove the factors influencing different results in LCCA. This study was conducted on hydrogen, ammonia, and electric energy, which are carbon-free fuels among various alternative fuels that are currently in the limelight. As the power source, a PEMFC and battery were used as the main power source, and a solar PV system was installed as an auxiliary power source to compare economic feasibility. Several cost data for LCCA were selected from various feasible case studies. As the difficulty caused by the storage and transportation of hydrogen and ammonia should not be underestimated, in this study, the LCCA considers not only the CapEx and OpEx but also fuel transport costs. As a result, fuel cell propulsion systems with hydrogen as fuel proved financial effectiveness for short-distance ferries as they are more inexpensive than ammonia-fuelled PEMFCs and batteries. The fuel cost takes around half of the total life-cycle cost during the life span.

T1  - Democracy and Human Rights in the Management of Small-Scale Fisheries in England
AN  - 2779562023
AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSF) in England face several challenges to their viability. We argue that the source of these challenges can be traced to the more dominant large-scale fisheries (LSF) sector which has more influence than SSF over government policies. A recent attempt to mitigate the impact of these challenges has been made by the Future of Inshore Fisheries initiative whose main prescription is co-management, i.e., giving SSF a participatory role with the government and LSF in the decision-making in English fisheries management. Co-management is a form of democracy and it may help the SSF to deal with their problems. However, in our view, the English SSF also require an acknowledgement of their human rights to a fair quota and protected access to productive inshore waters. In making this case, we draw on normative arguments to assert that human rights are prior to democratic processes. Our conclusion is that both democratic decision-making and human rights principles are needed to secure the English SSF from the real threat of extinction.

T1  - Impact of Blue Space Geometry on Urban Heat Island Mitigation
AN  - 2779545939
AB  - A growing body of literature recognises the importance of nature-based solutions in providing resilience to the effects of climate change by mitigating urban heat islands. However, a knowledge gap exists regarding the contribution of blue spaces to the urban environment. Recent evidence suggests that blue spaces within urban canyons can promote pollutant removal via the vertical transport of air under certain conditions, but this is inconclusive. Using a numerical solver that accounts for evaporation effects, we investigate the influence of blue space size and shape on the in-canyon flow structure, temperature and water vapour distribution. Simulations were performed for water bodies of varying size and shape at different temperatures compared to the surrounding air. Results suggest that inadequately sized warmer water bodies are unable to promote sufficient vertical transport for pollutant removal, leading to overturning and increased temperature and humidity levels at the pedestrian level, thereby worsening environmental conditions and increasing the risk of heat-related illness and mortality. Hence, larger water bodies are better suited to nocturnal transport of pollutants and accumulated warm air away from the urban surface, while smaller water bodies are better suited to providing localised evaporative cooling. Lastly, irregular water bodies may have a greater cooling effect across a larger area.

T1  - What Are We Teaching Engineers about Climate Change? Presenting the MACC Evaluation of Climate Change Education
AN  - 2779542593
AB  - Engineering underpins the progress of modern societies. However, engineering activities are a key driver of climate change and engineers are responsible in many ways for disaster risk reduction. It is therefore imperative that engineering education accurately portrays the impact that the profession has on our climate and equips engineers with the knowledge to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt infrastructure for climate resilience. Here, we explore how higher education prepares engineers to address the climate crisis via a curricula analysis of three departments (mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering). The pilot study investigated the extent of mitigation and adaptation to climate change (MACC) content across different disciplines by developing and applying an evaluation methodology. We found that module descriptions and learning objectives were largely without reference to MACC, further evidencing the dissociation of engineering education from the climate reality as cited in the literature. This novel approach goes beyond curricula analysis to integrate MACC within module outlines paving the way for future integration. This research demonstrates the urgent need for climate conscious engineering curricula.

T1  - Pharmaceutical Company Targets and Strategies to Address Climate Change: Content Analysis of Public Reports from 20 Pharmaceutical Companies
AN  - 2779511355
AB  - The pharmaceutical industry produces a large proportion of health system greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing to climate change. This urgently needs to be addressed. We aimed to examine pharmaceutical company climate change targets, GHG emissions, and strategies to reduce them. We performed content analysis of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies’ publicly available 2020/2021 reports, focusing on extracting information on their reported climate change targets, GHG emissions (and whether companies had demonstrated any reduction in emissions over their reporting period), and strategies being implemented to reduce company emissions and meet their targets. Nineteen companies have committed to reducing GHG emissions, ten to carbon neutrality and eight to net zero emissions between 2025 and 2050. Companies showed largely favorable reductions in scope 1 (in-house) and scope 2 (purchased energy), with variable results in scope 3 (supply chain) emissions. Strategies to reduce emissions included optimizing manufacturing and distribution, and responsible sourcing of energy, water, and raw materials. Pharmaceutical companies are setting climate change targets and reporting reduced emissions via a range of strategies. This varies, with scope to track actions and accountability to targets, improve consistency of reporting, especially of scope 3 emissions, and collaborate on novel solutions. There is need for further mixed methods research on progress with achieving reported climate change targets, as well as implementation of strategies to reduce emissions within the pharmaceutical industry.

T1  - The Role of Allotments and Community Gardens and the Challenges Facing Their Development in Urban Environments—A Literature Review
AN  - 2779507302
AB  - Current research largely focuses on the role of allotment gardens, the challenges facing them, and the direction of their future development in urban environments. The main idea behind the introduction of allotment gardens was to improve the living conditions and food supply of workers and the underprivileged. The impact of allotment gardening does not only concern the allotment gardeners but also the general public and the environment. It is important to emphasise that allotments have impacts not only on food production and outdoor physical activity, but also on the reuse of idle or neglected land, community development, therapeutic and nutritional benefits, and psychological benefits for allotment holders and residents. For this reason, this study captures six broad themes related to allotments: (1) community participation and cohesion, (2) health and well-being, (3) economic opportunities, (4) pollution, (5) urban planning and development, and (6) sustainable environment. The research is a systematic review in which steps were taken to minimise bias in the identification, selection, and summarisation of studies. The initial literature selection was based on a keyword search (title, abstract, and keywords) of the comprehensive literature databases Web of Science (all years) and Scopus (all years). The total scientific literature on which this review is based includes 162 research articles published between 1978 and July 2022. This work aims to fill these gaps and analyse existing knowledge by providing a detailed review of the academic literature, focusing not only on the benefits of community gardens and allotments in urban areas, but also on the existing problems related to allotments and urban gardening. Possible directions of development are also analysed based on the legal regulations in each country.

T1  - Selecting the ‘Sustainable’ Cow Using a Customized Breeding Index: Case Study on a Commercial UK Dairy Herd
AN  - 2779498812
AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate using a customized profit and carbon total merit index to identify sustainable milking cows and herd replacements within a commercial dairy herd. Balancing the economic, social and environmental aspects of milk production has gained interest given the increasing global demand for milk products. Furthermore, a farm-level customized breeding index with farm-derived weightings for biological traits would incorporate the effect of the farm environment. This study used a Markov chain approach to model a commercial dairy herd in the UK between the years 2017 and 2022. Production, financial, genetic and nutritional data for the herd were used as input data. The model derived the economic (GBP per unit) and carbon values (kilograms CO2-eq. emissions per unit) for a single phenotypic increase in milk volume, milk fat yield, milk protein yield, somatic cell count, calving interval and lifespan, which were used in a profit and carbon index. The study proposed a methodology for selecting individual milking cows and herd replacements based on their potential to increase herd profitability and reduce carbon emissions as a means to identify more sustainable animals for a given farm environment. Of the 370 cows and herd replacements studied, 76% were classified as sustainable with a desirable increase in profit and reduction in carbon emissions. Customized breeding indices with trait weightings derived from the farm environment and selecting individual animals on economic and carbon metrics will bring permanent and cumulative improvements to the sustainability of milk production with appropriate nutrition and management. The approach used can be applied to any commercial farm to select animals that are more sustainable.

T1  - Rainwater Energy Harvesting Using Micro-Turbines in Downpipes
AN  - 2779489562
AB  - Renewable energy sources are rapidly increasing in demand and importance as governments and countries around the globe begin to understand their vital role in reducing climate change. This project aimed to design and create an optimised micro-hydro turbine system for downpipes to harness the currently untapped potential energy from rainwater. Experimental methods were used to determine the magnitude of voltage output available at different rainfall intensities by simulating such flow rates on a hydraulic bench. The viability of this energy to power household appliances was then evaluated, and methods of increasing the voltage output were assessed, such as layering the turbines in a single downpipe or placing multiple downpipes around the building. The study determined that, during average rainfall in the UK, a single turbine could produce a maximum of 7.21 V of DC voltage, or 50.49 V during heavy rainfall—enough energy to power a mobile device charger or a vacuum cleaner, respectively. Therefore, this proves a high potential in rainwater energy harvesting as a renewable energy source. It was also concluded that a positive correlation occurred for both the number of turbines in a downpipe and the number of pipes around the building with the voltage output of the whole system.

T1  - Biological Deterioration and Natural Durability of Wood in Europe
AN  - 2779469895
AB  - In recent years, the use of wood has gained social interest, leading to a global increase in its demand. Yet, this demand is often covered by the production of woods of low natural durability against biological deterioration. The main biological agents with the potential to attack the structural integrity of wood are wood-decay fungi, saproxylic beetles, termites, and marine molluscs and crustaceans. In most circumstances, fungi are the main wood-deteriorating agents. To attack the cell wall, wood-decay fungi combine a complex enzymatic mechanism with non-enzymatic mechanisms based on low-molecular-weight compounds. In some cases, the larvae of saproxylic beetles can also digest cell wood components, causing serious deterioration to wooden structures. The impact of subterranean termites in Europe is concentrated in the Southern countries, causing important economic losses. However, alien invasive species of voracious subterranean termites are expanding their presence in Europe. Wooden elements in permanent contact with marine water can be readily deteriorated by mollusc and crustacean borers, for which current preservatives lack efficacy. The natural durability of wood is defined as the inherent resistance of wood to catastrophic action by wood-destroying organisms. Besides exposure to the climate, product design and use conditions, the natural durability of wood is key to the prediction of the service life of wooden products, which can be shortened due to the impact of global change. The major wood properties involved in natural durability are related to the composition of lignin in the cell wall, the anatomy of the xylem, nutrient availability, the amount and composition of heartwood extractives, and the presence of moisture-regulating components since wood moisture content influences the establishment of wood-degrading organisms.

AB  - The research project discussed in this paper is driven by the United Kingdom’s (UK’s) need to reduce operational energy and carbon by promoting the adoption of the Active Building (AB) concept for UK building projects. The AB concept offers a practical solution to reducing the operational energy use and carbon emissions of buildings by using emerging technologies applied to architectural design; thus, helping the UK meet its decarbonisation targets and, consequently, helping to combat the global problem of climate change. The aim of the project was to design and implement an AB Protocol with an AB Toolkit, to provide a knowledge base and sustainable architectural design guidance to aid the design of ABs. The AB Toolkit was tested, evaluated, and refined by engaging with architectural designers in the UK through focus groups (FGs) that combined data collection with knowledge dissemination—a method which provided a contribution to the continuous professional development (CPD) of architectural designers in the UK, while aiding the research project. The FG data proved the original hypothesis that a whole host of measures are needed to support the adoption of the AB concept (as outlined in the AB Protocol), but that some design guidance was needed initially to enable the development of other supporting measures. Therefore, the main output of this research project was the development of a structured approach to enable architectural designers and other built-environment professionals to adopt the AB concept for the delivery of net zero operational energy buildings, supporting the aims of the SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre, Swansea University, and the Active Building Centre (ABC). The method of data collection developed, and the structured approach to enabling the adoption of a new concept outlined, could be beneficial to other researchers.

T1  - Individualism and climate change policies: international evidence
AN  - 2779359778
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to examine the extent to which the cultural dimension of individualism/collectivism matters for international differences in climate change policy performance. This study postulates that individualistic societies, relative to their collectivistic counterparts, are more likely to address global climate change.Design/methodology/approachThe main hypothesis is tested using data for a world sample of up to 92 countries. To achieve causal inference, this study isolates exogenous sources of variation in individualistic cultures, based on blood distance to the UK and historical pathogen prevalence.FindingsThe core results suggest that individualistic countries are characterized by greater climate change policy performance. This study also finds evidence that individualism affects climate change policy adoption through enhancing governance and female political representation. Subnational analyses based on data from the World Values Survey indicate that survey participants with an orientation toward individualism tend to self-report positive attitudes to pro-environmental policies.Research limitations/implicationsThe main findings help improve the understanding of the deep origins of climate change policy performance, which is relevant for formulating policies that help mitigate the consequences of changing climate conditions.Originality/valueTo the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first study to link cultural traits of individualism and climate change policy performance across countries.

T1  - Environmental impact assessment in health technology assessment: principles, approaches, and challenges
AN  - 2778826964
AB  - To reduce harm to the environment resulting from the production, use, and disposal of health technologies, there are different options for how health technology assessment (HTA) agencies can consider environmental information. We identified four approaches that HTA agencies can use to take environmental information into account in healthcare decision making and the challenges associated with each approach. Republishing data that is in the public domain or has been submitted to an HTA agency we term the “information conduit” approach. Analyzing and presenting environmental data separately from established health economic analyses is described as “parallel evaluation.” Integrating environmental impact into HTAs by identifying or creating new methods that allow clinical, financial, and environmental information to be combined in a single quantitative analysis is “integrated evaluation.” Finally, evidence synthesis and analysis of health technologies that are not expected to improve health-related outcomes but claim to have relative environmental benefits are termed “environment-focused evaluation.”

T1  - A Climate Change and Sustainability Education Movement: Networks, Open Schooling, and the ‘CARE-KNOW-DO’ Framework
AN  - 2775029357
AB  - This study explores the interplay and close cooperation gap between universities, schools, enterprises, policymakers, and wider society for the joint development of actions for CCSE ‘Climate Change and Sustainability Education’. We argue that CCSE, as the integration of sustainability and eco-consciousness at all educational levels, should empower learners by providing competences to identify issues and responsible actions to shape a liveable planet for all. Underpinned by the CARE-KNOW-DO theoretical principles, we explore CCSE issues and provide a novel foundation for a new education movement to combine strategies, initiatives, and interventions towards learning ecologies. Findings of our Delphi Study with 27 expert academics, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policymakers of the UK Green-Forum presents seven recommendations to tackle the CCSE’s challenges: 1. Promote flexible real-context curriculum; 2. Foster cross-curricular practices with teachers’ training; 3. Establish CCSE definition with benchmarks including skills and qualifications; 4. Enhance learners’ agency through the cooperation of stakeholders and organisations; 5. Raise students’ passion for nature with a hopeful curriculum; 6. Increase green careers awareness through education, and 7. Implement tangible curriculum through policy-change with equity, diversity and inclusion. We present 60 green-initiatives and 33 green-skills for the CCSE, for empowering students to CARE-KNOW-DO actions towards a sustainable world with green-careers, green-lives, and green-societies.

T1  - Architecture Engineering and Construction Industrial Framework for Circular Economy: Development of a Circular Construction Site Methodology
AN  - 2775019632
AB  - All sectors have been affected by digital, economic, and demographic transitions. These will also be completely changing the paradigms of the construction industry, which is increasingly being pressured to implement strategic solutions in order to mitigate its own current environmental impact. Existing environmental standards and voluntary protocols are useful tools for reducing the environmental impact of buildings and infrastructures above all during the operation phase, but there is no consistent methodology for creating a circular and sustainable construction stage at the moment, probably because this represents a small stage in the entire life cycle of a structure; nevertheless, the construction industry impacts a lot on the environment and should be managed in a circular way. A detailed analysis of the current problem is provided, as well as a potential solution involving a transition to a circular economic model for the entire construction lifecycle, supported by innovative models and methodologies. The purpose of this article is to create a “Circular Construction Sites” (CCS) flow using circular concepts and to develop a circular methodology for construction sustainability, considering practical solutions related to materials, water, and waste management. According to the circular economy model, the circular construction site can communicate with other industrial ecosystems to promote external circularity and zero waste production. A set of potential key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring circularity processes is presented. Finally, a method is proposed that circularizes not only the building or infrastructure design, but also the construction phase.

T1  - Exploring the Role of the Connection Length of Screen-Printed Electrodes towards the Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions
AN  - 2774977903
AB  - Zero-emission hydrogen and oxygen production are critical for the UK to reach net-zero greenhouse gasses by 2050. Electrochemical techniques such as water splitting (electrolysis) coupled with renewables energy can provide a unique approach to achieving zero emissions. Many studies exploring electrocatalysts need to “electrically wire” to their material to measure their performance, which usually involves immobilization upon a solid electrode. We demonstrate that significant differences in the calculated onset potential for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be observed when using screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) of differing connection lengths which are immobilized with a range of electrocatalysts. This can lead to false improvements in the reported performance of different electrocatalysts and poor comparisons between the literature. Through the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, uncompensated ohmic resistance can be overcome providing more accurate Tafel analysis.

T1  - A Study on the Interdependence in Sustainable Mobility Tools and Home Energy Equipment Choices
AN  - 2774892508
AB  - Energy consumption in transportation and households are the main two sections of energy consumption in Europe. To cope with the challenges raised by energy security, sustainability, and pollution, great efforts have been made to encourage the transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles and car sharing. In terms of households, home renewable energy equipment such as heat pumps and solar panels are promising solutions. To accelerate the diffusion of these promising and environmentally friendly technologies, an abundance of studies has investigated the factors that impact the adoption of them. Most of the existing literature considered the choice behavior of vehicle types and choice behavior of energy equipment to be exogenous to other. Charging electric vehicles at home will lead to an increase in home energy costs. It is important to understand to what extent a household’s decision to purchase new mobility tools or energy equipment is affected by the other. This paper, therefore, attempts to investigate the correlation between the choice of home energy equipment and the choice of new mobility tools. An inverted sequence stated preference experiment was designed and conducted in the Netherlands to examine the interdependence of mobility tools choice and home energy equipment choice. Two logit models were presented to investigate how the choice of mobility tools and energy equipment impact each other. Results indicate that the promoting effect between electric vehicles and solar panels is bidirectional, while the promoting effect between electric vehicles and heat pumps is unidirectional.

T1  - Revisiting the Deep Geothermal Potential of the Cheshire Basin, UK
AN  - 2774890524
AB  - Deep geothermal energy can aid in the decarbonization of heat within the UK; this is required to meet net zero carbon emissions targets by 2050. The Cheshire Basin represents a significant opportunity for the development of deep geothermal resources; there are vast quantities of high permeability sandstones in hydraulic continuity, with temperatures favorable for direct heat use and, potentially, for power generation. Newly produced basal temperature maps in this study indicate the likely maximum temperatures for the basin, with the hottest temperature expected to be between 100 and 131.2 °C in the Crewe area. There have also previously been a range of estimates highlighting a geothermal resource within the basin to be in the region of 44.1 to 75 × 1018 J; however, previous estimates for heat in place are limited to simple volumetric or geometrical constraints. Therefore, this paper uses digitized depth and temperature maps to provide new estimates for the heat in place. Results suggest the resource has been underestimated and there is a need for more detailed evaluation. Depending on the geothermal gradient, the resource could be between 91 and 144 × 1018 J (1.26 to 1.45 × 1017 J/km2). Although there is a significant amount of heat in place, geological issues preventing development remain, such as the uncertainty in the quality of the reservoir at depth due to data limitations and the lateral continuity of the Manchester Marls Formation, which could act as a barrier to flow. Nevertheless, further regional assessment of the basin and data acquisition is required to build confidence in the reservoir quality and reduce uncertainty. This could unlock the basin for geothermal development.

T1  - Lack of ‘common sense’ in the climate change debate: Media behaviour and climate change awareness in the UK
AN  - 2771306340
AB  - Based on an online survey conducted among a representative sample in the United Kingdom (n = 1013), this article investigates the role of traditional and new media in predicting climate change awareness. It suggests that individuals make choices under an ideological convincement that is organised within specific cultural and political-economic boundaries. It shows that the Gramscian concept of cultural hegemony is still valuable to make sense of an incessant process of formation and fragmentation of equilibria between social groups. Interpreting hegemony as a not totalitarian communicative process also suggests that the media represent a ground for counterhegemonies to flourish and trigger political transformation. This study constructs two indexes of both scepticism and advocacy of climate change by showing some traits of these two perspectives in the United Kingdom. It also shows that the division between sceptics and advocates’ convincement is not ‘black and white’, but a transitional space exists between hegemonic and counter-hegemonic forces.

T1  - Warm Soil, Westerly Wind, and Wet Feet: Feeling and Measuring Ecological Time in the Roman World
AN  - 2770009575
AB  - Although climate change, pollution, and environmental degradation are contemporary problems, these are also challenges with deep historic roots in antiquity. 2,000 years ago, during the Roman Climate Optimum, a period of unusually warm, wet, and stable temperatures in the Mediterranean from roughly 200 BCE to 150 CE, the Romans altered the natural environment so greatly that they produced a level of pollution that was unparalleled until the Industrial Revolution. It is precisely in this contradictory time of unusually productive growth and destruction that we discover a blossoming of textual and visual ecological calendars illustrating how the Romans experienced the changing Mediterranean seasons. Roman agricultural treatises instruct us on specific agricultural tasks based on celestial movement, the arrival of particular winds, and on corporeal sensations, such as the warmth of the soil. Literary texts from the period portray kinship and shared corporeality between farmers and plants, with parent farmers listening to and assisting plant-children in achieving their desires. The concept of measuring time by means of the human body and its sensations is most explicit in the agricultural mosaics of the Late Roman period, which depict enslaved workers laboring, sweating, stomping, plowing, and performing seasonal tasks. While much of the conceptualization of indigenous ecological calendars is framed within the context of modern states, juxtaposing ancient predecessors and contemporary practices offers a new perspective on this topic.

T1  - Comparison of Short and Long-Term Energy Performance and Decarbonization Potentials between Cogeneration and GSHP Systems under MARKAL Scenarios
AN  - 2767294955
AB  - In response to the call for global carbon peaking and neutrality, this study mainly focuses on the comparison of energy-related carbon emissions and the performance of two promising heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning technologies (a ground source heat pump (GSHP) and cogeneration systems) over both short (2021–2030) and long (2031–2050) periods, considering the UK decarbonization plans. The simulation model of the building with the GSHP system is validated by the actual building heating energy data in 2020 and 2021, with yearly deviations of only 0.4–0.5%. The results show that the cogeneration system performed better than the GSHP system in a scenario when there was no electricity decarbonization plan in the future. However, under all of the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) scenarios, the GSHP system performed much better than the cogeneration system in terms of carbon reduction in both periods, which can achieve 47.8–84.4% and maximum 97.5% carbon emission savings in short and long-term periods, respectively, compared with the cogeneration system. Due to the truth that electricity decarbonization plans will be optimized and executed in the future, the GSHP system is more promising and recommended compared with cogeneration system in both short- and long-term periods in terms of only decarbonization potentials (e.g., reducing carbon emission and achieving carbon-related environmental protection).

T1  - Assessing Long-Term Medical Remanufacturing Emissions with Life Cycle Analysis
AN  - 2767266659
AB  - The unsustainable take-make-dispose linear economy prevalent in healthcare contributes 4.4% to global Greenhouse Gas emissions. A popular but not yet widely-embraced solution is to remanufacture common single-use medical devices like electrophysiology catheters, significantly extending their lifetimes by enabling a circular life cycle. To support the adoption of catheter remanufacturing, we propose a comprehensive emission framework and carry out a holistic evaluation of virgin manufactured and remanufactured carbon emissions with Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). We followed ISO modelling standards and NHS reporting guidelines to ensure industry relevance. We conclude that remanufacturing may lead to a reduction of up to 60% per turn (−1.92 kg CO2eq, burden-free) and 57% per life (−1.87 kg CO2eq, burdened). Our extensive sensitivity analysis and industry-informed buy-back scheme simulation revealed long-term emission reductions of up to 48% per remanufactured catheter life (−1.73 kg CO2eq). Our comprehensive results encourage the adoption of electrophysiology catheter remanufacturing, and highlight the importance of estimating long-term emissions in addition to traditional emission metrics.

T1  - Hospital Services to Improve Nutritional Intake and Reduce Food Waste: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2767257575
AB  - Background and Aims: Patients’ nutritional intake is a crucial issue in modern hospitals, where the high prevalence of disease-related malnutrition may worsen clinical outcomes. On the other hand, food waste raises concerns in terms of sustainability and environmental burden. We conducted a systematic review to ascertain which hospital services could overcome both issues. Methods: A systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines was conducted across MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing the effect of hospital strategies on energy intake, protein intake, and plate/food waste. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for RCTs. Results: Nineteen studies were included, assessing as many hospital strategies such as food service systems—including catering and room service—(n = 9), protected mealtimes and volunteer feeding assistance (n = 4), food presentation strategies (n = 3), nutritional counseling and education (n = 2), plant-based proteins meal (n = 1). Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, the results were narratively analysed. Conclusions: Although the results should be confirmed by prospective and large sample-size studies, the personalisation of the meal and efficient room service may improve nutritional intake while decreasing food waste. Clinical nutritionist staff—especially dietitians—may increase food intake reducing food waste through active monitoring of the patients’ nutritional needs.

T1  - System Dynamics Tools to Study Mediterranean Rangeland’s Sustainability
AN  - 2767241852
AB  - Rangelands are a key resource present all over the world and cover half of all emerged lands. They are even more important in drylands, where they cover 48% of the total area. Their intensification and the additional pressure added by climate change push these socio-ecological systems towards desertification. Over the last two decades, we have developed and applied System Dynamics (SD) models for the study of Mediterranean grasslands. In addition, we have designed procedures and analysis tools, such as global sensitivity analysis, stability analysis condition, or risk analysis, to detect the main drivers of these socio-ecological systems and provide indicators about their long-term sustainability. This paper reviews these works, their scientific background, and the most relevant conclusions, including purely technical and rangeland-related ones, as well as our experience as systemic modelers in a world driven by field specialists.

T1  - Institutional Settings and Effects on Agricultural Land Conversion: A Global and Spatial Analysis of European Regions
AN  - 2767241712
AB  - Spatial planning systems and institutions have a significant role in managing non-agricultural land growth in Europe and the assessment of how their implementation impacts on agricultural land consumption is of great significance for policy and institutional improvement. Reducing the area of agricultural land taken for urban development, or eliminating such conversion, is an international policy priority aiming to maintain the amount and quality of land resources currently available for food production and sustainable development. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of land use planning systems and institutional settings on urban conversion of agricultural land in the 265 NUTS2 level EU27 and UK regions. Taking these regions as the unit of our analysis, the research developed and used global and local econometrics models to estimate the effect based on socio-economic, institutional and land use data for the 2000–2018 period. There is limited research focusing on the impacts of institutional settings and planning types of the European countries on the conversion of agricultural land. Furthermore, existing research has not considered the spatial relationships with the determinants of agricultural land conversion and the response variable, therefore, our research aimed to contribute to the literature on the subject. The results showed that the types of spatial planning systems and institution variables significantly impact the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses. Socio-economic indicators and areas of agricultural and urban land have significant impact on agricultural land conversion for any type of spatial planning system. A further result was that decentralization and political fragmentation were positively associated with agricultural land conversion while quality of regional government and governance was negatively associated. A local regression model was assessed to explore the different spatial patterns of the relationships driving agricultural land conversion. The main empirical finding from this model was that there was spatial variation of driving factors of agricultural land conversion in Europe.

T1  - Machine Learning for Surrogate Groundwater Modelling of a Small Carbonate Island
AN  - 2767217177
AB  - Barbados is heavily reliant on groundwater resources for its potable water supply, with over 80% of the island’s water sourced from aquifers. The ability to meet demand will become even more challenging due to the continuing climate crisis. The consequences of climate change within the Caribbean region include sea level rise, as well as hydrometeorological effects such as increased rainfall intensity, and declines in average annual rainfall. Scientifically sound approaches are becoming increasingly important to understand projected changes in supply and demand while concurrently minimizing deleterious impacts on the island’s aquifers. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a physics-based groundwater model and surrogate models using machine learning (ML), which provide decision support to assist with groundwater resources management in Barbados. Results from the study show that a single continuum conceptualization is adequate for representing the island’s hydrogeology as demonstrated by a root mean squared error and mean absolute error of 2.7 m and 2.08 m between the model and observed steady-state hydraulic head. In addition, we show that data-driven surrogates using deep neural networks, elastic networks, and generative adversarial networks are capable of approximating the physics-based model with a high degree of accuracy as shown by R-squared values of 0.96, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. The framework and tools developed are a critical step towards a digital twin that provides stakeholders with a quantitative tool for optimal management of groundwater under a changing climate in Barbados. These outputs will provide sound evidence-based solutions to aid long-term economic and social development on the island.

T1  - Carbon Analysis, Life Cycle Assessment, and Prefabrication: A Case Study of a High-Rise Residential Built-to-Rent Development in the UK
AN  - 2767214642
AB  - Recent research relating to energy use and carbon emissions by buildings has started to move from operational energy carbon impacts to the embodied energy/carbon impacts of buildings, and the methods and approaches used in architectural design to reduce embodied carbon have become more prominent. From a practitioner’s perspective, working with an ‘in-house’ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool has become a growing trend for architects, and one perceived way of improving the LCA outcomes of a proposed building is to consider prefabrication of the construction process. Initiatives such as the Low Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) and government bodies such as Greater London Authorities (GLA) provide guidance on LCA and upfront carbon emission targets for transitioning to net zero by 2050. The aim of this study was to establish (i) the LCA impacts from prefabricated residential buildings against current benchmarks; (ii) boundaries and opportunities in architectural practice in the UK when conducting an LCA; (iii) the effectiveness of an in-house LCA tool. This study shows that, although the life-cycle emissions of this prefabricated building achieved a low band in the LETI labelling system, with 1076 kgCO2e/m², it still performs better than the business-as-usual model value of 1200 kgCO2e/m². The results also reveal that the construction industry is not ready to provide realistic data on the prefabrication process to test its advantages compared to conventional constructional methods. However, having an in-house LCA tool provides a faster and more comprehensive LCA due to the commitment to carbon assessment in the office and saves time compared to manual calculations.

T1  - Ecosystem Services in the Context of Agroforestry—Results of a Survey among Agricultural Land Users in the Czech Republic
AN  - 2767211509
AB  - Agroforestry, the use of trees at the interface between agricultural and forestry systems, is a key component of the multifunctional European landscape, where it provides a whole range of ecosystem services. Its main potential lies in the provision of services including increasing economic yield in agriculture and providing anti-erosion measures. The main objective of this research is to assess the perception of the providing ecosystem services of woody plants growing in agroforestry by farmers as key land users in the Czech Republic. Different aspects influencing farmers’ subjective perceptions were identified, especially depending on conventional versus organic farming methods. Respondents’ views were mapped using a structured questionnaire, which allowed for independently assessing the importance of windbreaks. Respondents considered regulatory ecosystem services the most important ones, in particular reducing soil erosion and flood risk, or increasing the resilience of the landscape to drought. Respondents perceived the physical obstruction of trees during mechanical tillage and the tenancy relationship with the land as the most significant problem with the introduction of agroforestry systems. The aim of this study is to promote innovative approaches in the national agricultural strategy in agroforestry as one of the tools for climate change adaptation towards sustainable agricultural production.

T1  - Remote working in construction: assessing the affordance of digitisation
AN  - 2765629751
AB  - Purpose>As remote working becomes increasingly popular, remote working could unlock new ways of working through digitisation. However, the construction sector has been slow to adopt digitisation in its processes, making digitisation difficult to assess whether this affordance may be well received and the current capabilities of digitisation to achieve this effectively. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interest in remote working amongst construction sector personnel and to examine the factors affecting remote working through digitisation affordances.Design/methodology/approach>Based on a case study of one of the largest contractor firms in the United Kingdom, an online questionnaire survey was used to collect responses from 125 construction professionals. Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to do basic statistical analysis on the results.Findings>The findings show that there is a general appetite for remote working on a flexible basis where a mix of “on-site” and “off-site” arrangement was deemed practical. This could potentially unlock significant time and cost savings as well as productivity gains. The main factors affecting remote working were the availability of interconnected systems allowing efficient communication and digital infrastructure that enable automated processes.Research limitations/implications>The research is limited to a large contractor company and may not be appropriate for small and medium-sized companies. The findings may benefit organisations to evaluate the practical needs of ensuring effective remote working in the construction industry and unlocking efficiencies.Originality/value>The paper adds value to understanding the affordances and constraints of digitisation for remote working from the perspective of construction professionals.

T1  - Social innovation, goal orientation, and openness: insights from social enterprise hybrids
AN  - 2763976676
AB  - Abstract We empirically examine social innovation and openness through a survey of social enterprise hybrids in the United Kingdom (UK). Social innovation refers to new products, processes, and services that respond to grand challenges. Social enterprises pursue economic, social, and environmental goals but vary in their goal orientation, namely the relative importance ascribed to such goals. We first explore the relationships between commercial, social, and environmental goal orientation and social innovation performance. Next, we consider the moderating impact of openness to external knowledge and ideas on social innovation performance. Our analysis finds positive and significant relationships between commercial and social goal orientation and social innovation performance, but no relationship with environmental goal orientation. In addition, the use of external sources of knowledge and ideas positively strengthens these relationships for both commercial and social goal orientation but not for environmental goal orientation. Our results reveal some important influences on social innovation, openness, and hybrid organizing.Plain English SummaryHeadline: The more social enterprises focus on both commercial and social goals, the more successful they are in improving their social innovation performance.Social innovation refers to new products, processes, and services that respond to a range of social challenges such as poverty, inequality, homelessness, health, and environmental issues.Our study suggests that the more social enterprises focus on both commercial and social goals, the higher their social innovation performance. In addition, the more open innovation-oriented social enterprises are, that is, the more they use external sources of knowledge and ideas, the more they can benefit from their commercial and social goals to improve their social innovation performance.Implications of our research for practice: social enterprises are encouraged not only to focus on both commercial and social goals but also to build relationships with external stakeholders. These external stakeholders can provide information on entrepreneurial opportunities, how to respond to problems and market and government failures, and how to remain successful while collaborating with a range of partners.

T1  - Innovative Resource Recovery from Industrial Sites: A Critical Review
AN  - 2761213079
AB  - Global net-zero pledges are instigating a societal shift from a fossil-fuel-based economy to renewables. This change facilitates the use of batteries, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines, etc., all of which are underpinned by critical metals. Raw metal extraction is not renewable and environmental pledges made by the government will not be met if this continues. Historic industrial sites contain vast waste stocks. These sites already have an established infrastructure for resource extraction. Applying green solvents and deep eutectic solvents (DES) to such sites for resource recovery alleviates pressure on existing raw extraction processes whilst generating more immediate stores of critical metal along with relatively insignificant environmental impacts. Existing remediation/recovery options have varying metal recovery efficiencies usually combined with high operating costs. Using novel green solvents, such as DES, on historic sites provides an opportunity to recover metals from waste that ordinarily would be looked over. Increased extraction of critical metals from waste material within the UK will reduce reliance on imported metals and improve critical metals security of supply to UK markets and the wider economy The use of these solvents provides an environmentally friendly alternative but also regenerates the legacy of waste from historic industrial sites and consequently implements a circular economy. Adopting the use of green solvents will meet EU environmental pledges, and boost the economy, by recovering metals from legacy sites to meet exponentially growing metal demand.

T1  - Towards Net Zero: Modeling Approach to the Right-Sized Facilities
AN  - 2761213024
AB  - As the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere increases, the concerns about carbon emissions are growing. Several net-zero initiatives are taking place around the globe to achieve a balance between the GHGs put into the atmosphere and those taken out. While most efforts present a sectorized approach, this paper describes the importance of integrating information across different sectors for effective modeling of carbon emissions and holistic reduction opportunity analysis. Using the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) campus as a test case, this work provides a web-based tool for INL stakeholders to use when engaging in strategic planning to achieve carbon emissions reduction. This net-zero engineering support tool (NEST) uses historical data as foundational information for applying the modeling framework. Prediction of CO2 emissions throughout project completion integrates various approaches and schedules aimed at energy conservation, fleet decarbonization, and other GHG reduction activities. Using NEST, stakeholders can visualize carbon emissions, electricity consumption, and costs for decision making when planning the pathway for reaching carbon net zero. The INL’s initiative to transition into an EV fleet was used to demonstrate the developed framework and the advantages of using NEST. It was shown that electrifying different fossil-fueled campus vehicles before 2030 with aggressive replacement schedules require high annual capital expenditure (CAPEX), which may not be available. The tool allows decision makers to test different replacement schedules and prioritize those that yield CAPEX below a certain threshold while meeting target milestones. While the demonstration focused on vehicle electrification, the developed framework lays the foundation for further quantitative analysis of other GHG reduction activities.

T1  - Catching versus Counting: Comparing the Pro-Environmental Attitudes, Behaviors, and Climate Concerns of Recreational Fishers and Citizen Scientists
AN  - 2761210713
AB  - The ongoing and interactive effects of climate change, overharvesting, and habitat loss on fish and fisheries impacts a wide array of stakeholders who rely on access to sustainable fish populations for their health, recreation, well-being, and income. Successful responses to these threats will require the involvement of stakeholders in co-developing solutions. Understanding the socio-psychological characteristics of these diverse stakeholders, including their environmental attitudes and behaviors, can potentially improve management support and effectiveness across and within these groups. Past research has focused on climate impacts and adaptation efforts in commercial fisheries, but less is known about climate-related perceptions and attitudes of recreational fishers and other stakeholders such as citizen scientists. This study investigated how pro-environmental attitudes (PEAs), pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs), and climate change concerns vary among fisheries-based recreationists based on activity type (recreational fishing, fish monitoring for citizen science) and specialization level. Among stakeholders, citizen scientists (fish counters) exhibited the strongest PEBs, followed by more specialized recreational fishers. Citizen scientists also had stronger PEAs than recreational fishers and non-fisher/non-citizen scientists, but there were no significant differences in PEAs across specialization levels. Citizen scientists showed greater concern for climate change than recreational fishers and non-fisher/non-citizen scientists. However, respondents overall showed greater concern for “the environment” than for climate change. Our results suggest that both activity type and specialization level are important considerations when developing strategies to promote pro-environmental behaviors and climate concerns and that communication frames centered on healthy ecosystems may be more effective with some stakeholders than those focused solely on climate change. We discuss implications for building public support of climate engagement efforts and sustainable, climate-resilient fisheries.

T1  - An Integrated Methodology for Scenarios Analysis of Low Carbon Technologies Uptake towards a Circular Economy: The Case of Orkney
AN  - 2761183132
AB  - This study aims to create a comprehensive, holistic approach to evaluate the environmental, energy, and economic impacts of air source heat pump deployment scenarios through: (i) a life cycle assessment of air source heat pumps in Orkney houses, (ii) energy systems optimisation modelling to optimise the performance of an air source heat pump coupled with thermal energy storage tank to reduce use phase related impacts in Orkney, (iii) modelling of Orkney’s domestic building stock to understand the housing condition, and (iv) economic modelling to analyse the life cycle cost of an air source heat pump and potential savings when replacing conventional heating systems. The results show that an 82% reduction in energy supply could be achieved when ambitious energy efficiency improvement measures are adopted in the circular economy scenario. The use phase related emissions could be reduced by 98% when the air source heat pump becomes the only heating technology in Orkney. However, the life cycle-wide approach suggests that strong commitments are required in the manufacturing stage of these technologies through implementing circular principles, such as including the use of secondary materials, eco-design, and reusability of all components. Moreover, total heating costs paid by consumers in Orkney could be reduced by 84% in the circular economy scenario when air source heat pump uptake is coupled with energy efficiency improvement measures, but it requires a £130 million investment to insulate the whole housing stock of Orkney. Future scenarios indicate that decision-making has significant importance on overall results. Therefore, circular economy standards for air source heat pump manufacturing and deployment are crucial to reduce the negative impacts of fuel poverty and reach the net zero target.

T1  - A Bidirectional Modular Cuk-Based Power Converter for Shore Power Renewable Energy Systems
AN  - 2761183055
AB  - Supplying shipping vessels with electricity at the ports can improve the air quality of the ports, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry, contribute to the economic growth, and increase the political dependency of the countries by reducing the dependence on conventional fossil fuels. Several countries promote supplying the vessels when they are docking at ports from renewable energy systems by establishing dedicated funding mechanisms to remove the obstacles facing the shore power systems. In this context, this paper presents a new modular power electronic converter for shore power systems at shipping ports, which can perform three functions. Firstly, it will harvest the energy from a renewable energy source, such as hydroelectric and solar photovoltaic (PV) sources and ensure maximum energy extraction. Secondly, it will control the power flow from these sources to the battery storage. Finally, it will control the power flow from the battery to the vessels and/or the utility grid when necessary. A current-source converter based on isolated Cuk converter is used as the submodule (SM) of the proposed modular converter due to several features. The Cuk SM can provide high efficiency, minimised dc capacitance, and flexible output voltage higher or lower than the input voltage from the PV modules. To verify the mathematical analyses and computer simulations, experimental results are obtained from a small-scale modular prototype controlled by a TMSF28335 DSP.

T1  - A Review of Tariffs and Services for Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles in Europe
AN  - 2761178243
AB  - Smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) is an essential approach to reduce the costs and maximise the benefits of increasing numbers of EVs being connected to the power grid. This article analyses 139 tariffs and services for smart EV charging available in Europe. It finds that while the market for smart EV charging services is growing, there is a lack of consumer information on the savings and broader environmental benefits it offers, such as integration of renewables. Offers are also unevenly distributed across the continent, resulting in unequal access to smart EV charging. The article outlines six strategies to establish framework conditions in energy markets that would address these gaps and establish smart charging as a standard means of charging, to ensure the beneficial integration of EVs into power grids.

T1  - A Review of Power Co-Generation Technologies from Hybrid Offshore Wind and Wave Energy
AN  - 2761178049
AB  - Renewable energy resources such as offshore wind and wave energy are environmentally friendly and omnipresent. A hybrid offshore wind-wave energy system produces a more sustainable form of energy that is not only eco-friendly but also economical and efficient as compared to use of individual resources. The objective of this paper is to give a detailed review of co-generation technologies for hybrid offshore wind and wave energy. The proposed area of this review paper is based on the power conversions techniques, response coupling, control schemes for co-generation and complimentary generation, and colocation and integrated conversion systems. This paper aims to offer a systematic review to cover recent research and development of novel hybrid offshore wind-wave energy (HOWWE) systems. The current hybrid wind-wave energy structures lack efficiency due to their design and AC-DC-AC power conversion that need to be improved by applying an advanced control strategy. Thus, using different power conversion techniques and control system methodologies, the HOWWE structure can be improved and will be transferrable to the other hybrid models such as hybrid solar and wind energy. The state-of-the-art HOWWE systems are reviewed. Critical analysis of each method is performed to evaluate the best possible combination for development of a HOWWE system.

T1  - Optimisation of Ultrasound Pretreatment of Microalgal Biomass for Effective Biogas Production through Anaerobic Digestion Process
AN  - 2761177864
AB  - The anaerobic digestion, AD, process presents a solution for sustainable waste management, greenhouse gas mitigation and energy production for growing population needs and requirements. Adopting a biorefinery approach that utilises different feedstock may enhance energy production and support optimisation of the anaerobic digestion process. Algae is a promising feedstock that could be used for energy production via the anaerobic digestion process. Microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrates and lipids; however, many species of algae exhibit tough cell walls that could also be difficult to digest and may influence or inhibit the efficiency of the AD process. This study concentrated on the comparison of AD remediation of two marine algal biomass species, Tetraselmis suecica and Nannochloropsis oceanica. The two species were pre-treated with an ultrasound technique and compared for their methane production using biochemical methane potential tests. For Tetraselmis, a specific methane production of 0.165 LCH4/KgVS was observed; however, for Nannochloropsis, a value of 0.101 LCH4/KgVS was observed for the samples treated with ultrasound. The BMP results from this study show that among the two micro-algae species tested, Tetraselmis suecica is found to be a better substrate for methane production potential. Contrary to increasing the specific methane production, ultrasound cavitation caused a slight decrease in the specific methane production values for both Nannochloropsis oceanica and Tetraselmis suecica biomass residues. The pre-treatment of the biomass using ultrasound techniques provided comparable results and can be recommended for effective bioenergy production. However, further research is required for the optimisation of the pre-treatment of microalgae and for the integration of microalgal biorefineries for circular economy.

T1  - A Review of Microgrid Energy Management Strategies from the Energy Trilemma Perspective
AN  - 2761177396
AB  - The energy sector is undergoing a paradigm shift among all the stages, from generation to the consumer end. The affordable, flexible, secure supply–demand balance due to an increase in renewable energy sources (RESs) penetration, technological advancements in monitoring and control, and the active nature of distribution system components have led to the development of microgrid (MG) energy systems. The intermittency and uncertainty of RES, as well as the controllable nature of MG components such as different types of energy generation sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, heating, and cooling systems are required to deploy efficient energy management systems (EMSs). Multi-agent systems (MASs) and model predictive control (MPC) approaches have been widely used in recent studies and have characteristics that address most of the EMS challenges. The advantages of these methods are due to the independent characteristics and nature of MAS, the predictive nature of MPC, and their ability to provide affordable, flexible, and secure MG operation. Therefore, for the first time, this state-of-the-art review presents a classification of the MG control and optimization methods, their objectives, and help in understanding the MG operational and EMS challenges from the perspective of the energy trilemma (flexibility, affordability, and security). The control and optimization architectures achievable with MAS and MPC methods predominantly identified and discussed. Furthermore, future research recommendations in MG-EMS in terms of energy trilemma associated with MAS, MPC methods, stability, resiliency, scalability improvements, and algorithm developments are presented to benefit the research community.

T1  - Examining the variation of soil moisture from cosmic-ray neutron probes footprint: experimental results from a COSMOS-UK site
AN  - 2760026416
AB  - Utilising cosmic-ray neutron probes is a relatively new approach in obtaining larger area soil moisture and various operational monitoring networks have been established worldwide utilising this technology to measure operationally this parameter. One such network located in the United Kingdom (UK) is the Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System, so-called COSMOS-UK, established in 2013. The present study aims at investigating the true footprint and the variations within the footprint detectable area at the COSMOS-UK sites using as a case study one such site located in Riseholme, UK. At the selected experimental site extensive fieldwork was conducted in July 2017 that allowed examining the agreement among the soil moisture data retrieved by the Time Domain Transmissometer (TDT) sensors and the corresponding estimates from the COSMOS-UK network station probe. The COSMOS-UK site footprint was compared using GPS-aided information from ground instrumentation, assisted by drone imagery acquisition and the implementation of geospatial interpolation methods in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. Altogether, this information was used for assessing the soil moisture footprint extent from the COSMOS-UK site. The COSMOS-UK station footprint was representative for an area shorter in size than the alleged footprint of 600 m diameter, as generally proposed in various relevant investigations. The COSMOS network slightly overestimated soil moisture content measured by the TDT sensor probes installed in the area. Our study findings although concern specifically the studied experimental site contribute towards efforts aiming at assessing the COSMOS-UK soil moisture measurement footprint showcasing the added value of geospatial analysis in this direction.

T1  - Accelerated photosynthesis routine in LPJmL4
AN  - 2759903951
AB  - The increasing impacts of climate change require strategies for climate adaptation. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are one type of multi-sectorial impact model with which the effects of multiple interacting processes in the terrestrial biosphere under climate change can be studied. The complexity of DGVMs is increasing as more and more processes, especially for plant physiology, are implemented. Therefore, there is a growing demand for increasing the computational performance of the underlying algorithms as well as ensuring their numerical accuracy. One way to approach this issue is to analyse the routines which have the potential for improved computational efficiency and/or increased  accuracy when applying sophisticated mathematical methods.In this paper, the Farquhar–Collatz photosynthesis model under water stress as implemented in the Lund–Potsdam–Jena managed Land DGVM (4.0.002) was examined. We additionally tested the uncertainty of most important parameter of photosynthesis as an additional approach to improve model quality. We found that the numerical solution of a nonlinear equation, so far solved with the bisection method, could be significantly improved by using Newton's method instead. The latter requires the computation of the derivative of the underlying function which is presented. Model simulations show a significantly lower number of iterations to solve the equation numerically and an overall run time reduction of the model of about 16 % depending on the chosen accuracy. Increasing the parameters θ and αC3 by 10 %, respectively, while keeping all other parameters at their original value, increased global gross primary production (GPP) by 2.384 and 9.542 GtC yr-1, respectively. The Farquhar–Collatz photosynthesis model forms the core component in many DGVMs and land surface models. An update in the numerical solution of the nonlinear equation in connection with adjusting globally important parameters to best known values can therefore be applied to similar photosynthesis models. Furthermore, this exercise can serve as an example for improving computationally costly routines while improving their mathematical accuracy.

T1  - Change in Rhetoric but not in Action? Framing of the Ethical Issue of Modern Slavery in a UK Sector at High Risk of Labor Exploitation: JBE
AN  - 2755977297
AB  - This article shows how the ethical framing of the contemporary issue of modern slavery has evolved in UK construction, a sector in which there is a high risk of labor exploitation. It also examines how these framing dynamics have inhibited the emergence of a common framework of action to deal with the issue. We draw on both framing theory and the literature on the discursive construction of moral legitimacy. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that actors seeking to shape the debate bring their own moral schemes to justify and construct the legitimacy of their frames. Actors cluster their views around five evolving frames: human rights issue (later shifting to hidden crime), moral issue, management issue (later shifting to human moral obligation), social justice issue, and decent work issue—which promote particular normative evaluations of what the issue is, who is responsible, and recommendations for action. Our study contributes to a dynamic and political understanding of the meaning making of modern slavery. We identify the antecedents and conditions that have forestalled the emergence of new patterns of action to tackle modern slavery in the UK construction sector thereby evidencing the effects of the interplay of morally competing frames on field-level change.

T1  - Six Memos for the Current Time. Rethinking six contemporary sociological matters in light of the emotional dynamics shaping them
AN  - 2830355549
AB  - This contribution is inspired by Italo Calvino's Harvard Lectures which should had been hold at Harvard in 1986 and were never delivered because of Calvino's sudden and premature death. Calvino began his American lectures with a series of reflections on six qualities that he considered essential for good literature and then broadened his reflections to other (no strictly literary) dimensions of our existence. This article is based on a series of reflections on six sociological subjects that I consider essential to frame the recent pandemic, and then it extends such reflections to other realms of our everyday life. Care, Welfare, Death, Politics, Europe, and Marginality: the common denominator of these different key sociological subject matters is represented by emotions and their too often unacknowledged role in interpreting and explaining contemporary phenomena. They have been chosen as they represent a number of core themes which are considered key to help us demarcating the field of our critical analyses of the pandemic, but also because they epitomise paradigmatic contexts where the political relevance of emotional dynamics vividly emerge. In this sense, the main goal of this contribution is to invite scholars from different disciplinary perspectives to further investigate these key sociological subject matters by taking into account the crucial role of emotions, shedding light on the not so visible links between micro- and macro-levels of analysis and their implications for social change, and broadening our reflections to other (no strictly sociological) dimensions of our existence.

T1  - Evaluation of OPTIMISE (Online Programme to Tackle Individual’s Meat Intake Through Self-regulation): Cohort Study
AN  - 2759756789
AB  - Background: There is an urgent need to reduce society’s meat consumption to help mitigate climate change and reduce noncommunicable diseases.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate changes in meat intake after participation in an online, multicomponent, self-regulation intervention.
Methods: We conducted a pre-post observational study among adult meat eaters in the United Kingdom who signed up to a website offering support based on self-regulation theory to reduce meat consumption. The program lasted 9 weeks (including a 1-week baseline phase, a 4-week active intervention phase, and a 4-week maintenance phase), comprising self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning, and health and environmental feedback. Meat intake was estimated during weeks 1, 5, and 9 using a 7-day meat frequency questionnaire. We analyzed the change in mean daily meat intake from baseline to week 5 and week 9 among those reporting data using a hierarchical linear mixed model. We assessed changes in attitudes toward meat consumption by questionnaire and considered the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.
Results: The baseline cohort consisted of 289 participants, of whom 77 were analyzed at week 5 (26.6% of the baseline sample) and 55 at week 9 (71.4% of the week 5 sample). We observed large reductions in meat intake at 5 and 9 weeks: –57 (95% CI –70 to –43) g/day (P<.001) and –49 (95% CI –64 to –34) g/day (P<.001), respectively. Participants’ meat-free self-efficacy increased, meat-eating identities moved toward reduced-meat and non–meat-eating identities, and perceptions of meat consumption as the social norm reduced. Participants who completed the study reported high engagement and satisfaction with the intervention.
Conclusions: Among people motivated to engage, this online self-regulation program may lead to large reductions in meat intake for more than 2 months, with promising signs of a change in meat-eating identity toward more plant-based diets. This digital behavior change intervention could be offered to complement population-level interventions to support reduction of meat consumption.

T1  - Accelerating sustainability transitions: the case of the hydrogen agenda in the North West region of England
AN  - 2755673778
AB  - Low-carbon hydrogen can assist in addressing the global crisis of climate change by significantly decarbonizing a range of heavy-emitting sectors. In the United Kingdom, hydrogen technologies are at the forefront of the net zero-emission roadmaps of many industrial clusters. However, with impending timeframes linked to emission targets and other decarbonization objectives, it is increasingly important to understand how to accelerate such transitions to hydrogen. There is, to date, a notable gap in the academic literature concerning the acceleration of sustainability transitions. Using the case of the hydrogen agenda in England’s North West region, we explore how the transition to hydrogen can be accelerated and thus begin to contribute toward filling this omission. In doing so, we use data collected through semi-structured interviews and from the public domain to unpack and develop upon an existing framework that emerged from the European Commission funded-project Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability (ARTS). The framework comprises five acceleration mechanisms which local sustainability transition initiatives have adopted. This analysis generates novel findings in relation to why actors in the region have faced difficulties in instrumentalizing as well as the mechanism’s overall importance in acceleration. We use these challenges to inform several recommendations which policy makers could adopt to accelerate the North West’s, and wider UK’s, transition to hydrogen.

T1  - Navigating sustainability and health trade-offs in global seafood systems
AN  - 2753717892
AB  - Seafood is expected to play a key role in improving access to healthy diets while providing food products with relatively low rates of greenhouse gas emissions. However, both nutrients and carbon footprints vary among species and production methods, and seafood consumption is further influenced by price and consumer preference, such that it is unclear which species are best placed to provide low-emissions nutritious seafood. Here, we use seafood production data to assess the nutritional value, carbon emissions, sustainability, affordability, and availability of seafood available to UK consumers. Globally, most seafood products are more nutritious and emit lower greenhouse gases than terrestrial animal-source foods, particularly small pelagic fishes and bivalves that contributed to recommended intakes for 3–4 essential dietary nutrients at the lowest emissions. For seafood products relevant to UK markets and consumers, Atlantic mackerel had the highest availability (i.e. landings) of all wild-caught UK seafood and lowest carbon footprint of all finfish, with one fillet portion exceeding recommended intakes of three nutrients (selenium, vitamins B12 and D). We found that price and sustainability of UK seafood, both factors in consumer demand, had considerable trade-offs with nutrients, carbon footprint, and availability. Farmed salmon, for example, were produced in large volumes but were relatively more expensive than other seafood, whereas highly nutritious, low-emissions farmed mussels had limited production volumes. The UK’s seafood system is therefore not currently optimised to produce nutritious, low-emissions seafood in large amounts. Policies that promote local consumption of affordable species already produced in high volumes, such as mackerel, could improve intakes of nutrients that are deficient in the UK population at relatively low environmental cost.

T1  - "Of Blessed Memory": The Recasting of Elizabeth I as England's Protestant Patron Saint, 1603–1645
AN  - 2748890503
AB  - The Nicodemite conformity during the Marian years of Elizabeth I and some of her trusted advisors, particularly William Cecil (1520-1598), were occasionally objects of open criticism by Puritans.2 Elizabeth I's final years were overshadowed by fears of a contested succession, leading to division and factionalism within the court.4 Additionally, a series of volcanic eruptions on the other side of the world in conjunction with the already cooling climate during the Little Ice Age led to bitterly cold winters in the 1590s.

[...]in order to "right the world," there was a concerted attempt to have men reassert their patriarchal power.9 Despite this, there were some men who depicted Elizabeth I as the great Protestant reformer of England and a model of correct behavior.

The men extolling Elizabeth I in such literature may have meant her to be an example to men in authority rather than women, but by presenting Elizabeth I as an exemplar with a Godgiven mission of Reformation, they, nonetheless, communicated the message that women could be religious authorities and speak with authority outside the confines of their own homes, inspiring women in the mid to late seventeenth century to act on that image.

For Elizabeth's funeral, the use of a funeral effigy was revived as was the canopy which was like the one used in a Corpus Christi processions.12 Protestant England was careful to avoid any accusations of committing idolatry, thereby, violating the second of the Ten Commandments, but Elizabethan authorities willingly appropriated elements of pre-Reformation saint veneration that did not involve kneeling before an image to create an experience of English mourning.

T1  - Putting climate change at the heart of education: Is England's strategy a placebo for policy?
AN  - 2747924371
AB  - In this paper we present an analysis of the sustainability and climate change strategy for education and children's services systems in England, produced by the Department for Education. Using critical discourse analysis, we juxtapose qualitative data collected from >200 youth teachers and teacher educators in the context of co‐creating a manifesto for education and environmental sustainability. Through analysis of these two datasets, we evaluate the government's proposals for climate education and sustainability. We find that the strategy foregrounds economic concerns, with educational priorities driven by the ‘net zero’ policy agenda, and an over‐reliance on increased science‐focused knowledge and skills. The strategy suggests an absence of governmental responsibility and attention to the political dimensions of climate change. This is in contrast to stakeholder perspectives which see economic priorities as part of the problem and call for pro‐environmental action at all levels, including from policymakers. The strategy has a depoliticising effect as it introduces additional demands for teachers and schools without the associated enabling policy environment. We argue that the strategy runs the risk of becoming a placebo for policy, with the appearance of ‘doing something’ whilst failing to address the fundamental policy problem.

T1  - Socio-technical modelling of UK energy transition under three global SSPs, with implications for IAM scenarios
AN  - 2745405192
AB  - The potential for using findings from socio-technical energy transition (STET) models in integrated assessment models (IAMs) has been proposed by several authors. A STET simulation model called TEMPEST, which includes the influence of societal and political factors in the UK’s energy transition, is used to model three of the global shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) at the national level. The SSP narratives are interpreted as inputs to TEMPEST, which drive scenario simulations to reflect varying societal preferences for mitigation measures, the level of political support for energy transition, and future economic and population trends. SSP1 and SSP2 come close to meeting UK net zero targets in 2050 but SSP5 does not reach net zero before 2080. An estimate of the total societal, political, and economic cost of scenarios indicates that while SSP1 achieves the best emissions reductions it also has the highest total cost, and SSP2 achieves the best ratio between rate of emissions reductions and total cost. Feasibility appears to be highest for SSP2 since it is the least different to historical precedent. Current UK government energy strategy is closer to the narrative in SSP5, however, which has the highest total cost and exceeds an estimated carbon budget by 32%. Three key TEMPEST findings are recommended for use in IAMs: (i) the uncertainty in emissions savings due to variability in political and societal support for energy transition, (ii) the influence of negative societal pushback to policies in achievement of expected policy outcomes, and (iii) the combined influence on energy service demand of disposable income, public willingness to participate, and user impacts from measures.

T1  - Accumulations and Cascades: Burmese Elephants and the Ecological Impact of British Imperialism
AN  - 2734500502
AB  - What effect did British imperialism in Myanmar have on frogs? And, given that the lives of these small amphibian creatures were rarely ever recorded or preserved in archival collections, how might we find out? Sceptical readers may also wish to take a step back and ask, why should historians even care about their lives? These are unusual questions for a historian to confront, but they are occasioned by the deepening conversation between ecology and history. This paper delves into the ecological impact of colonial rule in Myanmar through the lives of Burmese elephants and the creatures that they lived alongside. In it I argue that the concepts of ‘accumulation’ and ‘cascade’ are useful for enabling historians to apprehend the full extent of the impact of imperialism on the lives of animals.

T1  - Firms and climate change: a review of carbon risk in corporate finance
AN  - 2730343146
AB  - This paper provides an overview of financial economics-based research on carbon risk with an emphasis on corporate finance. In the corporate finance literature, carbon risk refers to the impact of society’s transition to a low-carbon economy on firm value due to tightening regulations, changing consumer preferences, reputational damage, etc. We focus on the links between carbon risk and different firm performance factors, such as firm risk, cost of capital, financial performance, firm value, and corporate decisions. Although research on carbon risk is still emerging in the corporate finance field, the amount of literature on this topic has been increasing, especially in the last 2 years. We find that some results are robust, while others are mixed. This indicates that conflicting hypotheses still exist, leading to a need for more in-depth exploration.

T1  - Risk perception associated with an emerging agri-food risk in Europe: plant viruses in agriculture
AN  - 2729509483
AB  - BackgroundResearch into public risk perceptions associated with emerging risks in agriculture and supply chains has focused on technological risks, zoonotic diseases, and food integrity, but infrequently on naturally occurring diseases in plants. Plant virus infections account for global economic losses estimated at $30 billion annually and are responsible for nearly 50% of plant diseases worldwide, threatening global food security. This research aimed to understand public perceptions of emerging risks and benefits associated with plant viruses in agriculture in Belgium, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK.MethodsOnline qualitative semi-structured interviews with 80 European consumers were conducted, including 20 participants in each of Belgium, Slovenia, the UK, and Spain. Microsoft Streams was used to transcribe the interview data, and NVivo was utilized to code the transcripts and analyze the data.ResultsThe results indicate that, while study participants were relatively unfamiliar with the plant viruses and their potential impacts, plant viruses evoked perceived risks in a similar way to other emerging risks in the agri-food sector. These included risks to environment and human health, and the economic functioning of the relevant supply chain. Some participants perceived both risks and benefits to be associated with plant viruses. Benefits were perceived to be associated with improved plant resistance to viruses.ConclusionsThe results provide the basis for risk regulation, policy, and communication developments. Risk communication needs to take account of both risk and benefit perceptions, as well as the observation that plant viruses are perceived as an emerging, rather than an established, understood, and controlled risk. Some participants indicated the need for risk–benefit communication strategies to be developed, including information about the impacts of the risks, and associated mitigation strategies. Participants perceived that responsibility for control of plant viruses should be conferred on actors within the supply chain, in particular primary producers, although policy support (for example, financial incentivization) should be provided to improve their motivation to instigate risk mitigation activities.

T1  - Attitudes to climate change risk: classification of and transitions in the UK population between 2012 and 2020
AN  - 2703694918
AB  - Strategies for achieving carbon emissions goals presuppose changes in individual behaviour, which can be indirectly nudged by interventions or tailored information but ultimately depend upon individual attitudes. Specifically, the perception that climate change is low risk has been identified as a barrier to participation in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Therefore, understanding public attitudes towards climate change risk is an important element of reducing emissions. We applied k-means cluster analysis to explore attitudes to climate change risk in the UK population using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, a national survey running from 2009 to present. We identified three distinct attitude clusters: “Sceptical”, “Concerned”, and “Paradoxical” in both waves 4 (from 2012 to 2014) and 10 (from 2018 to 2020) of this survey. The Sceptical cluster tended to deny the seriousness of climate change and the urgency or even the necessity of dealing with it. The Concerned cluster displayed anxiety about climate change risks and supported action to reduce them. The Paradoxical cluster acknowledged the reality of climate change impacts but did not support actions to mitigate them. We further observed statistical associations between cluster membership and the social characteristics of the participants, including sex, age, income, education, and political affiliation. We also found a temporal stability of cluster structure between the two waves. However, the transition matrices indicated a general transition away from the Sceptical and Paradoxical clusters, and toward the Concerned cluster between wave 4 to wave 10. The findings suggest that more tailored public information campaigns regarding climate change risk may be necessary.

T1  - The simulation of mineral dust in the United Kingdom Earth System Model UKESM1
AN  - 2736227878
AB  - Mineral dust plays an important role in Earth system models and is linked to many components, including atmospheric wind speed, precipitation and radiation, surface vegetation cover and soil properties and oceanic biogeochemical systems. In this paper, the dust scheme in the first configuration of the United Kingdom Earth System Model UKESM1 is described, and simulations of dust and its radiative effects are presented and compared with results from the parallel coupled  atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (GCM) HadGEM3-GC3.1. Not only changes in the driving model fields but also changes in the dust size distribution are shown to lead to considerable differences to the present-day dust simulations and to projected future changes. UKESM1 simulations produce a present-day, top-of-the-atmosphere (ToA) dust direct radiative effect (DRE – defined as the change in downward net flux directly due to the presence of dust) of 0.086 W m-2 from a dust load of 19.5 Tg. Under climate change pathways these values decrease considerably. In the 2081–2100 mean of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway  SSP5–8.45 ToA DRE reaches 0.048 W m-2 from a load of 15.1 Tg. In contrast, in HadGEM3-GC3.1 the present-day values of -0.296 W m-2 and 15.0 Tg are almost unchanged at -0.289 W m-2 and 14.5 Tg in the 2081–2100 mean. The primary mechanism causing the differences in future dust projections is shown to be the vegetation response, which dominates over the direct effects of warming in our models. Though there are considerable uncertainties associated with any such estimates, the results presented demonstrate both the importance of the size distribution for dust modelling and also the necessity of including Earth system processes such as interactive vegetation in dust simulations for climate change studies.

T1  - Heritage:&nbsp;A History of How We Conserve Our Past
AN  - 2625547747
AB  - What is heritage? When was it invented? What is its place in the world today? What is its place tomorrow? Heritage is all around us: millions belong to its organisations, tens of thousands volunteer for it, and politicians pay lip service to it. When the Victorians began to employ the term in something approaching the modern sense, they applied it to cathedrals, castles, villages and certain landscapes. Since then a multiplicity of heritage labels have arisen, cultural and commercial, tangible and intangible - for just as every era has its notion of heritage, so does every social group, and every generation.In Heritage, James Stourton focuses on elements of our cultural and natural environment that have been deliberately preserved: the British countryside and national parks, buildings such as Blenheim Palace and Tattersall Castle, and the works of art inside them. He charts two heroic periods of conservation - the 1880s and the 1960s - and considers whether threats of wealth, rampant development and complacency are similar in the present day. Heritage is both a story of crisis and profound change in public perception, and one of hope and regeneration.

T1  - River water temperature demonstrates resistance to long‐term air temperature change
AN  - 2742861940
AB  - Ecosystem health and water quality of rivers are dependent on their temperature. With ongoing human‐induced climate change causing increases in air temperature across the globe, it is anticipated the stream temperatures will rise too—in turn increasing the rates of biogeochemical stream processes and potentially threatening the viability and health of aquatic organisms. To understand the relationship between climate change and stream temperature response, the longer the records that can be analysed, the more the robust the analysis for detecting change. In this study, we analyse records from 263 catchments from across the United Kingdom for 45 years from 1974 to 2019 to assess the link between air temperature and stream temperature change. To give the most precise analysis of these long records, Bayesian hierarchical modelling was used and showed that: (i) The Bayesian hierarchical approach was 59% more precise, that is, reduced uncertainty on long‐term trends, than using simple linear regression. (ii) The increase in annual average air temperature over 45 years across the United Kingdom showed no significant differences between 22 weather stations and gave a 45‐year change of 1.35 ± 0.9°C. (iii) Trends in annual mean stream temperature change varied from −2.3 °C to 2.0 °C over 45 years, with the mean over 263 sites being 0.5 °C over 45 years. (iv) 1% of rivers showed a stream temperature trend significantly greater than the air temperature trend but 3% of sites showed a stream temperature trend significantly lower than zero. (v) 74% of all river sites showed no significant monotonic trend, either positive or negative, in water temperature even after 45 years. The observed declines in stream temperature could be ascribed to the closures of thermoelectric power stations but it is unclear why the stream temperature at some sites has risen faster than air temperature. The study shows that mean river temperature was well buffered against changes in air temperature—a 1°C rise in air temperature giving 0.37°C in mean stream temperature.

T1  - Building local capacity for managing environmental risk: a transferable framework for participatory, place-based, narrative-science knowledge exchange
AN  - 2739326558
AB  - This paper evaluates a unique, transdisciplinary participatory research and knowledge exchange methodology developed in the Drought Risk and You (DRY) project and offers it as a transferable framework for others engaging stakeholders and systemic connections with environmental risk. Drought in the UK is a complex, diffuse and hidden risk, involving multiple stakeholders and systemic connections across diverse sectors. Historically, drought risk management has been underpinned by specialist science and technology implemented by statutory stakeholders. This paper critically evaluates the social learning from a longitudinal research process that involved co-working with seven river catchment-based, multi-stakeholder groups. The DRY project was a creative experiment in bringing drought science and stories into the same space, aiming to reveal different knowledges—specialist science, practical sector-level insight, and local knowledge—as a new evidence base to support better decision-making in UK drought risk management. An evaluative multi-method research methodology was overlaid on this process, using surveys, within meeting reflective evaluations, and summative semi-structured narrative interviews. This paper reflects on participant experiences of the ‘open’ scientific modelling development, ‘storying’ approaches, and their iterative interaction. It outlines the enablers, inhibitors and required support for this engagement process, which aimed to facilitate integration of different forms of knowledge as evidence, with social and sustainability learning among diverse stakeholders at its core. The process offered opportunity for valuable experiential learning as researchers of the nuanced impacts of intersecting factors on participatory place-based methods. It showed that similar approaches to science-narrative dialogic processes can play out locally to integrate aspects of social and sustainability learning in different ways. This sustainability learning provided a valuable platform for creative multi-stakeholder scenario-ing possible drought futures for increased local climate resilience. It then proposes a transferable research framework that promotes participatory, place-based, narrative-science knowledge exchange for building local capital for managing systemic environmental risk.

T1  - Agent-Based Modeling of Alternative Futures in the British Land Use System
AN  - 2739204748
AB  - Socio-economic scenarios such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) have been widely used to analyze global change impacts, but representing their diversity is a challenge for the analytical tools applied to them. Taking Great Britain as an example, we represent a set of stakeholder-elaborated UK-SSP scenarios, linked to climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways), in a globally-embedded agent-based modeling framework. We find that distinct model components are required to account for divergent behavioral, social and societal conditions in the SSPs, and that these have dramatic impacts on land system outcomes. From strong social networks and environmental sustainability in SSP1 to land consolidation and technological intensification in SSP5, scenario-specific model designs vary widely from one another and from present-day conditions. Changes in social and human capitals reflecting social cohesion, equality, health and education can generate impacts larger than those of technological and economic change, and comparable to those of modeled climate change. We develop an open-access, transferrable model framework and provide UK-SSP projections to 2080 at 1 km2 resolution, revealing large differences in land management intensities, provision of a range of ecosystem services, and the knowledge and motivations underlying land manager decision-making. These differences suggest the existence of large but underappreciated areas of scenario space, within which novel options for land system sustainability could occur.

T1  - Terrestrial carbon sequestration under future climate, nutrient and land use change and management scenarios: a national-scale UK case study
AN  - 2737145394
AB  - Carbon sequestration (Cseq) in soils and plant biomass is viewed as an important means of mitigating climate change. Recent global assessments have estimated considerable potential for terrestrial Cseq, but generally lack sensitivity to climate warming, nutrient limitations and perspective on local land use. These are important factors since higher temperatures can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, nutrient availability affects plant productivity, while land use pressures put broader constraints on terrestrial organic matter inputs and storage. Here, we explore the potential for Cseq under changing land use, climate and nutrient conditions in a UK-based national scale case study. We apply an integrated terrestrial C–N–P cycle model with representative ranges of high-resolution climate and land use scenarios to estimate Cseq potential across the UK. If realistic UK targets for grassland restoration and afforestation over the next 30 years are met, we estimate that an additional 120 TgC could be sequestered by 2100 (similar to current annual UK greenhouse gas emissions or roughly 7% of net emission cuts needed in meeting net zero), conditional on climate change of <2 °C. Conversely, we estimate that UK arable expansion would reduce terrestrial carbon storage by a similar magnitude. The most pessimistic climate trajectories are predicted to cause net losses in UK soil carbon storage under all land use scenarios. Warmer climates substantially reduce the potential total terrestrial carbon storage gains offered by afforestation and grassland restoration. We conclude that although concerted land use change could make an important moderate contribution to national level Cseq for countries like the UK, soil Cseq only provides a contribution if we are on a low emission pathway, and is therefore conditional on deep global cuts to emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation and soil degradation.

T1  - Sustainable production of healthy, affordable food in the UK: The pros and cons of plasticulture
AN  - 2734838366
AB  - An evolving green agenda as the UK seeks to achieve ‘net zero’ in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, coupled with our new trading relationship with the European Union, is resulting in new government policies, which will be disruptive to Britain's traditional food and farming practices. These policies encourage sustainable farming and land‐sparing to restore natural habitats and will provide an opportunity to address issues such as high emissions of GHGs and dwindling biodiversity resulting from many intensive agricultural practices. To address these and other food challenges such as global conflicts and health issues, Britain will need a revolution in its food system. The aim of this paper is to make the case for such a food revolution where additional healthy food for the UK population is produced in‐country in specialised production units for fruits and vegetables developed on sites previously considered unsuitable for crop production. High crop productivity can be achieved in low‐cost controlled environments, making extensive use of novel crop science and modern controlled‐environment technology. Such systems must be operated with very limited environmental impact. In recent years, growth in the application of plasticulture in UK horticulture has driven some increases in crop yield, quality and value. However, the environmental cost of plastic production and plastic pollution is regarded as a generational challenge that faces the earth system complex. The distribution of plastic waste is ubiquitous, with a significant pollution load arising from a range of agricultural practices. The primary receptor of agriplastic pollution is agricultural soil. Impacts of microplastics on crop productivity and quality and also on human health are only now being investigated. This paper explores the possibility that we can mitigate the adverse environmental effects of agriplastics and thereby exploit the potential of plasticulture to enhance the productivity and positive health impact of UK horticulture.

T1  - ‘Can't see the forest for the trees’: The importance of fungi in the context of UK tree planting
AN  - 2734838267
AB  - Tree planting now forms a major part of the UK climate mitigation strategy, with targets to increase the forest cover from the current 13% to 17%–20% by 2050. A tree planting strategy on this scale requires a significant amount of planning, bringing together expertise from a wide range of practitioners. We highlight four key reasons why fungi should be considered in tree planting strategies:1. Fungi can cause severe tree disease.2. Fungi can cause significant human health burdens.3. Forest soil carbon and nutrient cycling is controlled by fungi.4. Climate change is already affecting fungi.Following from these four reasons, we explore the ways in which the negative effects of fungi, such as plant and human disease, can be mitigated against, whilst also protecting and promoting the benefits of fungi in carbon storage and biodiversity. Based on this, we outline seven guidelines which should be integrated into existing tree planting guidelines and UK policy:A. Monitor tree fungal disease emergence and spread, including in source material trade (e.g. seeds and saplings).B. Choose tree species combinations appropriate to the specific habitat and appropriate for biodiversity and carbon storage goals.C. Develop and implement a widely accessible fungal spore forecast to complement existing pollen forecasts.D. Protect existing ancient and mature woodlands.E. Promote planting on suitable land types, avoiding grasslands and wetlands.F. Assess proposed and existing forest sites, ideally using a combination of fungal fruit body surveys and eDNA techniques.G. Develop and implement the UK Fungi Red List into UK law.

T1  - Updated projections of UK heat-related mortality using policy-relevant global warming levels and socio-economic scenarios
AN  - 2732039112
AB  - High temperatures and heatwaves are associated with significant impacts on human health. With continued global temperature increases, extreme thresholds relevant to health will be exceeded more frequently. This study provides an updated spatial analysis of heat-related mortality for the UK, using the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) at 1.5 °C–4 °C global warming levels, and embedding population and demographic data from the recently released UK Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (UK-SSPs). Climate change will lead to an increase in heat-related mortality in the future, exacerbated by increased exposure due to increasing population. We find an increase from ∼1400 average annual deaths in the near-past (1990–2019) (95% CI: 1299–1485), to ∼2500 (2304–2794), ∼3700 (3280–4214), ∼8200 (7376–9072) and >18 000 (16 690–20 394) average annual deaths at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C respectively (assuming no adaptation). This is considered a high-end estimate due to the assumption of high population growth (UK-SSP5). Older populations are shown to be most vulnerable. A large proportion of heat-related deaths (76% (74%–79%) with 1.5 °C global warming) are attributed to more moderate (1 °C–5 °C) increases above regional temperature thresholds as opposed to extremes. Our results provide a timely update that can serve as a first step to supporting future UK climate policy and risk assessments. Future research considering nonlinearity in the health response to heat exposure is vital.

T1  - A scenario-based approach to predict energy demand and carbon emission of electric vehicles on the electric grid
AN  - 2726159004
AB  - UK plans to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2030 to be replaced by electric vehicles (EVs). The question is, will the UK’s electrical grid infrastructure ready for this change? This comparative study investigates the effect of UK green vehicles on the electrical grid and presents a new insight into improving their energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the electrical grid. The results show that even when there is a very high level of market penetration of EVs, the overall effect on annual energy consumption may seem minimal. On the contrary, the effect that EVs may have on the electrical grid is dependent on the time-of-day EVs are being charged. Therefore, this study concludes that measures need to be put in place to control charging times of EVs and this would help restrict the total daily electricity and electrical energy demands. The introduction of EVs reduces the overall CO2 emissions mainly because a proportion of petrol and diesel cars are replaced by EVs. However, CO2 emissions can only reduce up to a certain level and this reduction of CO2 will have less effect due to an increasing number of EVs in the electrical grid. To reduce CO2 emissions further, the electricity that relies on high-carbon fossil fuels in the electrical grid should be set at the minimum level.

T1  - Damming news: Geospatial media discourse analysis of dams
AN  - 2718742488
AB  - Dams are a globally important social-ecological issue, and the practice of removing aging or obsolete dams is increasing in many countries where rivers have been used to fuel industrial growth. News media play an important role in providing information and raising awareness about dam-related decision making and patterns in news media coverage can shape public sense-making about potentially controversial dam decisions. This research focuses on spatial patterns of news media references to “dam removal” georeferenced to a New England dams database, the types of dam removal characteristics that contribute to newsworthiness, and specific media framing strategies. We develop a method, known as DAMMDA, that combines a large geodatabase of dam features and corpus of news media articles. We find that spatial patterns of “dam removal” news media coverage do not necessarily coincide with the actual occurrence of removed dams, nor the distribution of extant dams, in the landscape. Instead, a minority of dams with specific characteristics make up the majority of dam media references. Such “newsworthy dams” are capable of generating hydroelectricity, are situated on large rivers, are located in urban areas, or have already been removed. Further, references to newsworthy dams are often used to frame discussions about future dam decisions in other locations in New England and across the United States. We conclude by reflecting on how this approach is relevant for understanding complex and interconnected factors that can shape controversial sustainability issues, such as the relationships between news media and social-ecological characteristics of infrastructures within landscapes.

T1  - Amateur runners more influenced than elite runners by temperature and air pollution during the UK's Great North Run half marathon
AN  - 2718246173; IND607813647
AB  - The short- and long-term impacts of air pollution on human health are well documented and include cardiovascular, neurological, immune system and developmental damage. Additionally, the irritant qualities of air pollutants can cause respiratory and cardiovascular distress. This can be heightened during exercise and especially so for those with respiratory conditions such as asthma. Meteorological conditions have also been shown to adversely impact athletic performance; but research has mostly examined the impact of pollution and meteorology on marathon times or running under laboratory settings. This study focuses on the half marathon distance (13.1 miles/21.1 km) and utilises the Great North Run held in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, between 2006 and 2019. Local meteorological (temperature, relative humidity, heat index and wind speed) and air quality (ozone, nitrogen dioxide and PM₂.₅) data is used in conjunction with finishing times of the quickest and slowest amateur participants, along with the elite field, to determine the extent to which each group is influenced in real-world conditions. Results show that increased temperatures, heat index and ozone concentrations are significantly detrimental to amateur half marathon performances. The elite field meanwhile is influenced by higher ozone concentrations. It is thought that the increased exposure time to the environmental conditions contributes to this greater decrease in performance for the slowest participants. For elite athletes that are performing closer to their maximal capacity (VO₂ max), the higher ozone concentrations likely results in respiratory irritation and decreased performance. Nitrogen dioxide and PM₂.₅ pollution showed no significant relationship with finishing times. These results provide additional insight into the environmental effects on exercise, which is particularly important under the increasing effects climate change and regional air pollution. This study can be used to inform event organisation and start times for both mass participation and major elite events with the aim to reduce heat- and pollution-related incidents.

T1  - Likelihood of Extreme Early Flight of Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Across the UK
AN  - 2823854638
AB  - Myzus persicae (Sulzer, Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a major global crop pest; it is the primary aphid vector for many damaging viruses and has developed resistance to most insecticides. In temperate regions, the risk of widespread crop infection and yield loss is heightened following warm winters, which encourage rapid population growth and early flight. Estimates of the frequency and magnitude of warm winters are, therefore, helpful for understanding and managing this risk. However, it is difficult to quantify the statistical distribution of climate events, particularly extremes, because climate observations represent just a small sample of the possible climate variations in a region. The purpose of this study was to establish a large-scale relationship between temperature and M. persicae observations across the UK and apply this to a very large ensemble of climate model simulations, which better sample the variability in climate, to quantify the current likelihood of extreme early M. persicae flight across the UK. The timing of M. persicae flight was shown to be significantly related to January-February mean temperature, where a 1°C warmer/cooler temperature relates to about 12 d earlier/later flight. Climate model simulations predict 40% likelihood of experiencing a year with unprecedented early M. persicae flight during the next decade in the UK. Results from this method can help crop managers assess the long-term viability of crops and management practices across the UK and provide early warning information for targeting pest surveillance activities on the locations and timings at highest risk of early M. persicae flight.

T1  - Brexit implications for sustainable energy in the UK
AN  - 2734653382
AB  - Brexit has potentially wide-ranging implications for UK policy, although little is known about what these are yet. Now, post the transition period, is a good time to consider its actual impacts as opposed to what was expected by academics, and by proponents of Brexit. In the absence of any established theory of EU-exit, and drawing on insights from (de-)Europeanisation, Brexit energy and climate policy studies, and political economy, this article develops a framework to identify the impact of EU-exit on UK energy policy. This is applied to sustainable energy, an area in urgent need of policy development to meet legally binding national targets. We conclude that, so far, despite leaving various EU bodies there has been relatively little divergence from Europeanised policy; that new UK energy and climate policies, required to replace EU membership benefits, are relatively less effective; and that hard-pressed civil servants have been drawn away from other important policymaking tasks.

T1  - Navigating a shifting agri‐environment policy landscape to conserve butterflies
AN  - 2723307318
AB  - For decades, agri‐environment schemes (AES) within the United Kingdom have served as a policy tool for conserving butterflies. However, the UK's 2016 decision to leave the European Union (EU) means the overarching framework for AES, the EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), is being replaced by a new independent agri‐environment policy, the Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme. Here, we examine the shift from CAP towards ELM and explore its implications for butterfly conservation across England, as a devolved administration, within the United Kingdom. We identify the key changes between the current Countryside Stewardship scheme and the incoming ELM scheme and present recommendations for policymakers to ensure policy design and delivery can benefit efforts to conserve butterflies, and indeed wildlife more generally, in England. This is an opportune moment to contribute to discussions on the emerging agri‐environment scheme policy within the United Kingdom as the ELM scheme is trialed, revised, and implemented.

T1  - Radiative impact of improved global parameterisations of oceanic dry deposition of ozone and lightning-generated NOx
AN  - 2723307218
AB  - We investigated the radiative impact of recent process-based improvements to oceanic ozone (O3) dry deposition parameterisation and empirical improvements to lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen (LNOx) parameterisation by conducting a 5-year simulation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator – United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (ACCESS-UKCA) global chemistry–climate model, with radiative effects of O3, methane (CH4) and aerosol included. Compared to the base parameterisations, the global consequences of the two improved parameterisations on atmospheric composition are dominated by theLNOx change (which increases the LNOx production from 4.8 to 6.9 Tg N yr-1) and include (a) an increase in the O3 column of 3.75 DU, and this O3 change is centred on the tropical upper troposphere where O3 is most effective as a radiative forcer; (b) a decrease of 0.64 years in the atmospheric lifetime of CH4 due to an increase in hydroxyl radical, which corresponds to a decrease of 0.31 years in the CH4 lifetime per Tg N yr-1 change in LNOx; (c) an increase of 6.7 % in the column integrated condensation nuclei concentration; and (d) a slight increase in high-level cloud cover. The two combined parameterisation changes cause an increase of 86.3 mW m-2 in the globally-averaged all-sky net downward top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux (which is akin to instantaneous radiative forcing), and only 5 % of which is due to the dry deposition parameterisation change. Other global radiative changes from the use of the two parameterisations together include an increase in the downward longwave radiation and a decrease in the downward shortwave radiation at the earth's surface. The indirect effect of LNOx on aerosol and cloud cover can at least partly explain the differences in the downward shortwave flux at the surface. It is demonstrated that although the total global LNOx production may be the same, how LNOx is distributed spatially makes a difference to radiative transfer. We estimate that for a reported uncertainty range of 5±3 Tg N yr-1 in global estimates of LNOx, the uncertainty in the net downward TOA radiation is ±119 mW m-2. The corresponding uncertainly in the atmospheric methane lifetime is ±0.92 years. Thus, the value of LNOx used within a model will influence the effective radiative forcing (ERF) and global warming potential (GWP) of anthropogenic CH4, and influence the results of climate scenario modelling.

T1  - Threats to UK freshwaters under climate change: Commonly traded aquatic ornamental species and their potential pathogens and parasites
AN  - 2722819470
AB  - The aquatic ornamental industry, whilst providing socio-economic benefits, is a known introduction pathway for non-native species, which if invasive, can cause direct impacts to native species and ecosystems and also drive disease emergence by extending the geographic range of associated parasites and pathogens and by facilitating host-switching, spillover and spill-back. Although current UK temperatures are typically below those necessary for the survival and establishment of commonly-traded tropical, and some sub-tropical, non-native ornamental species, the higher water temperatures predicted under climate-change scenarios are likely to increase the probability of survival and establishment. Our study aimed primarily to identify which of the commonly-traded non-native ornamental aquatic species (fish and invertebrates), and their pathogens and parasites, are likely to benefit in terms of survival and establishment in UK waters under predicted future climate conditions. Out of 233 ornamental species identified as traded in the UK, 24 were screened, via literature search, for potential parasites and pathogens (PPPs) due to their increased risk of survival and establishment under climate change. We found a total of 155PPPs, the majority of which were platyhelminths, viruses and bacteria. While many of the identifiedPPPswere already known to occur in UK waters,PPPscurrently absent from UK waters and with zoonotic potential were also identified. Results are discussed in the context of understanding potential impact, in addition to provision of evidence to inform risk assessment and mitigation approaches.

T1  - Footprint beds record Holocene decline in large mammal diversity on the Irish Sea coast of Britain
AN  - 2719636107
AB  - Long-term monitoring along the Irish Sea coast of Britain at Formby has identified hundreds of animal and human footprints in 31 discrete sediment beds. A new programme of radiocarbon dating shows that the Formby footprints span at least 8,000 years of the Holocene Epoch from the Mesolithic period to Medieval times. In a landscape largely devoid of conventional archaeology and faunal records, we show how species data from the footprint stratigraphy document long-term change in both large mammal diversity and human behaviour. The footprint beds record shifting community structure in the native fauna through an era of profound global change. As sea levels rose rapidly in the Early Holocene, men, women and children formed part of rich Mesolithic intertidal ecosystems from ~9,000 to 6,000 cal bp, with aurochs, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, beaver, wolf and lynx. Doggerland was reclaimed by the sea in this period. In the agriculture-based societies that followed, after 5,500 cal bp human footprints dominate the Neolithic period and later beds, alongside a striking fall in large mammal species richness. Stacked footprint beds can form multimillennial records of ecosystem change with precise geographical context that cannot be retrieved from site-based fossil bone assemblages.The authors analyse hundreds of animal and human footprints spanning at least 8,000 years at Formby on the Irish Sea coast of Britain. In the absence of conventional faunal records, the footprints document long-term changes in large mammal diversity and human activity during the Holocene.

T1  - The evolution of pyrotechnology in the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe
AN  - 2718020543
AB  - Pyrotechnology, the ability for hominins to use fire as a tool, is considered to be one of the most important behavioural adaptations in human evolution. While several studies have focused on identifying the emergence of fire use and later Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthal combustion features, far fewer have focused on modern human fire use. As a result, we currently have more data characterizing the hominin fire use prior to 50,000 years before present (BP), than we do for Upper Palaeolithic of Europe. Here we review the available data on Upper Palaeolithic fire evidence between 48,000 and 13,000 years BP to understand the evolution of modern human pyrotechnology. Our results suggest regional clustering of feature types during the Aurignacian and further demonstrate a significant change in modern human fire use, namely in terms of the intensification and structural variation between 35,000 and 28,000 years BP. This change also corresponds to the development and spread of the Gravettian technocomplex throughout Europe and may correspond to a shift in the perception of fire. Additionally, we also show a significant lack of available high-resolution data on combustion features during the height of last glacial maximum. Furthermore, we highlight the need for more research into the effects of syn- and post-depositional processes on archaeological combustion materials and a need for more standardization of descriptions in the published literature. Overall, our review shows a significant and complex developmental process for Upper Palaeolithic fire use which in many ways mirrors the behavioural evolution of modern humans seen in other archaeological mediums.

T1  - Correcting ozone biases in a global chemistry–climate model: implications for future ozone
AN  - 2717619833
AB  - Weaknesses in process representation in chemistry–climate models lead to biases in simulating surface ozone and to uncertainty in projections of future ozone change. We here develop a deep learning model to demonstrate the feasibility of ozone bias correction in a global chemistry–climate model. We apply this approach to identify the key factors causing ozone biases and to correct projections of future surface ozone. Temperature and the related geographic variables latitude and month show the strongest relationship with ozone biases. This indicates that ozone biases are sensitive to temperature and suggests weaknesses in representation of temperature-sensitive physical or chemical processes. Photolysis rates are also an important factor, highlighting the sensitivity of biases to simulated cloud cover and insolation. Atmospheric chemical species such as the hydroxyl radical, nitric acid and peroxyacyl nitrate show strong positive relationships with ozone biases on a regional scale. These relationships reveal the conditions under which ozone biases occur, although they reflect association rather than direct causation. We correct model projections of future ozone under different climate and emission scenarios following the shared socio-economic pathways. We find that changes in seasonal ozone mixing ratios from the present day to the future are generally smaller than those simulated without bias correction, especially in high-emission regions. This suggests that the ozone sensitivity to changing emissions and climate may be overestimated with chemistry–climate models. Given the uncertainty in simulating future ozone, we show that deep learning approaches can provide improved assessment of the impacts of climate and emission changes on future air quality, along with valuable information to guide future model development.

T1  - 20% of uncertainty in yield estimates could be caused by the radiation source
AN  - 2675587862; IND607779958
AB  - Solar radiation is the energy for all biological, physical, and chemical processes of the earth's surface system, and affects the growth and development of crops at all stages. But the diverse data sources and fusion algorithms lead to large differences in the radiation values in various climate datasets. Accurate estimates of the radiation data is not an easy task, the uncertainty of which and the impact on crop yield simulation remains unknown. In this study, the total solar radiation amounts from four independent global radiation datasets were shown considerable heterogeneity across regions and cropping seasons. Forcing the dynamic crop models with the four radiation inputs produced similarly great uncertainties of simulated yield in most regions, with the greatest uncertainty up to 30% of average yield for wheat in Europe. The global-scale uncertainty of simulated yield is increasing during the past three decades and would reach up to 20% of its averages in the future, equivalent to 300 million tons when converting to the global crop production. The results of this study suggest that the previously projected crop yield changes with climate change have large uncertainties propagated from solar radiation data sources used for projections. These uncertainties may mislead the assessment of future food security.

T1  - Factors influencing the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: the case of seven horticultural farms in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2753442592
AB  - The production of fruits and vegetables is expected to increase in the United Kingdom (UK) as a response to increasing consumers’ demand, coupled with impacts of Brexit on the imports from the European Union (EU). Retailers and consumers are more aware of the environmental impact and provenance of food and are demanding to their suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices. Seven horticultural farmers and farm managers across the UK were interviewed to investigate the implementation of sustainable practices, and the motivations and enablers for adoption, as well as perceptions on sustainability and climate change. Factors influencing adoption mainly were efficiency and cost reduction, regulations, and market demand, even though, environmental, and social consciousness also played a role in adoption. There was little evidence that participation in knowledge networks or the perception of climate change and impacts, and of carbon footprint assessments influenced the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, but this finding deserves further investigation. Farmers’ awareness of the importance of soil was clear and governments should encourage farmers’ involvement in the monitoring of soil health, as a mean of engaging them in the wider discussion about the implementation of sustainable land management, including climate change adaptation and mitigation.

T1  - The J. Derek Bewley Career Lecture. Seeds–plants–crops–biodiversity–environment–people: illustrating understanding and ideas
AN  - 2738085909
AB  - The J. Derek Bewley Career Lectures presented at the triennial meetings of the International Society of Seed Science support early-career seed scientists by providing retrospective views, from those late in their careers, of lessons learned and future implications. Ambition, ability, inspiration, foresight, hard work and opportunity are obvious career requirements. The importance of mentoring and teamwork combined with the clear communication of results, understanding and ideas are emphasized. The role of illustration in research, and its dissemination, is outlined: illustration can support hypothesis development, testing and communication. Climate change may perturb the production of high-quality seed affecting conservation as well as agriculture, horticulture and forestry. An illustrative synthesis of the current understanding of temporal aspects of the effects of seed production environment on seed quality (assessed by subsequent seed storage longevity) is provided for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). Seed science research can contribute to complex global challenges such as future food supplies from seed-propagated crops in our changing climate whilst conserving biological diversity (through seed ecology and technologies such as ex situ plant genetic resources conservation by long-term seed storage in genebanks), but only if that research can be – and then is – applied.

T1  - Tax policies to reduce carbon emissions
AN  - 2726006105
AB  - Carbon taxes or similar pricing instruments could play a crucial role in helping countries decarbonise their economies. No country has a single carbon price that applies to all greenhouse gas emissions. The UK is typical in having adopted a complex patchwork of policies that raise the cost of different polluting activities to different degrees, resulting in implied carbon taxes that vary greatly across sources of emissions. We document and quantify these inconsistencies in the case of the UK, and assess the case for greater uniformity after accounting for considerations of efficiency, distribution, carbon leakage and the use of alternative policy instruments. We argue for greater rationalisation of environmental taxes in the UK and other developed economies.

T1  - Residents’ comfort perceptions in domestic heritage buildings
AN  - 2719491653
AB  - Reducing energy and associated carbon emissions from the existing built environment is critically important to meet our climate goals. Heritage buildings are often presented in the literature as energy inefficient, and uncomfortable to inhabit. There is however little research into residents’ perceptions of comfort in these buildings to support this view, while there is some evidence to suggest that heritage buildings may be more thermally comfortable than generally assumed. This paper interrogates a survey of 147 residents of pre-1940 heritage buildings in Cumbria, UK, to examine residents’ comfort perceptions. This survey is compared with secondary data from other UK studies on residential comfort. Results are elucidated with more detailed responses from interviews with 16 heritage households. Three key findings were made. First, heritage buildings are perceived to have broadly comparable thermal performance to more modern UK buildings by their residents. Second, the survey results and interviews found that residents perceive their buildings to perform particularly well in summer, keeping comfortably cool in hot weather. In contrast, the literature suggests that newer homes often appear to suffer from overheating. Third, although many Cumbrian residents found their buildings draughty, a large percentage would not prefer less ventilation, with case study participants citing their enjoyment of fresh air. These results are highly relevant for successful approaches to renovation and the implementation of the European Renovation Wave. Renovations are often promoted to heritage residents for their comfort improvement potential. However, if buildings are already perceived as broadly comfortable this may not be a key driver. Alternative motivations may therefore need to be identified to drive renovation uptake. The findings also highlight the importance of maintaining positive aspects such as good summer performance.

T1  - Understanding the long-term impact of flooding on the wellbeing of residents: A mixed methods study
AN  - 2716914490
AB  - As the effects of climate change become more visible, extreme weather events are becoming more common. The effects of flooding on health are understood but the long-term impact on the well-being of those affected need to be considered. This mixed methods secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey examined the extent to which being flooded in the past is associated with ongoing concerns about flooding. Survey data were collected from residents in Hull 11 years after the initial flooding event. Respondents were asked about the floods in 2007 and their current level of concern about flooding. Ordinal logistic regression explored the effect of age and tenancy status as predictors of current concern. Textual data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Responses were received from 457 households, of whom 202 (48%) were affected by flooding in 2007. A fifth of respondents were very concerned about future flooding. Those who were not flooded were significantly less concerned about the risk of future flooding (U = 33391.0, z = 5.89, p < 0.001). Those who reported negative health and wellbeing effects from the floods were significantly more concerned about future flooding than those whose health was not affected (U = 7830.5, z = 4.43, p < 0.001). Whilst some residents were reassured by the introduction of new flood alleviation schemes, others did not feel these were adequate, and worried about the impact of climate change. The financial and emotional impacts of the floods still resonated with families 11 years after the event, with many fearing they would not cope if it happened again. Despite the 2007 floods in Hull happening over a decade ago, many of those affected continue to experience high levels of anxiety when storms are forecast. Residents feel powerless to protect themselves, and many remain unconvinced by the presence of new flood alleviation schemes. However, with the ongoing threat of climate change, it may be that other residents are unrealistic in their expectation to be ‘protected’ from flood events. Therefore, public health agencies need to be able to mobilize organizations to come together to pro-actively support families affected by flooding, to ensure those in need do not fall through the gaps of public healthcare delivery.

T1  - A systematic managerial perspective on the environmentally sustainable construction practices of UK
AN  - 2714788485
AB  - Construction industry, though is the backbone of any economy, still add a significant portion of emissions, utilising energy supplies, and reasoning in bulk of waste production. The sustainable construction practices are the only solution considering the global climatic challenges. Owing its enormous benefits, a lot of sustainable constructions projects are built around the world, both in developed and developing countries. However, considering the innovative material and technological involvement, and lack of knowledge and expertise, such sustainable construction projects are not always successful. This research aims to investigate the barriers and factors impacting sustainability in the construction projects. More specifically, its primary purpose is to have the perspective of managers on the actors and barriers of sustainable construction in the UK. A mixed method was used to collect the data, one in the mean of questionnaire survey, and the second through the case study. To acquire quantitative data, a snowball sampling was applied to collect the questionnaire survey based data from 128 UK construction managerial positions, such as system managers, sustainability managers, project managers and construction managers, etc. The quantitative acquired data was analysed using mean analysis, relevant importance index (RII), correlation and multiple hierarchical regression. The RII analysis discovered that sustainable construction designs is a top drivers of sustainable construction practices, whereas excessive concentration on price is found as the top impediment of sustainable construction practices. It was also shown by the hierarchical regression analysis that stakeholders factors, project management factors and technological factors significantly impact to sustainable construction practice. However, surprisingly the role of barriers was not observed in the sustainable construction practices of the UK. The same findings were also confirmed with the case study analysis of the Kier Group plc, which believes in the sustainable construction practices. Hence, it is needful for the positive sides of these factors be considered and duly exploited. The research findings provide interesting industrial insights towards sustainable construction projects, while providing useful directions to the industrialists, policymakers and construction professionals, not only by reducing the unfavourable effects, but also by proposing the intention of restoring factors of the environment, economic and social sustainability.

T1  - The potential of vertical extension at the city scale
AN  - 2714742651
AB  - The UK construction sector is central to the climate and housing crises and must now deliver vast amounts of residential accommodation whilst reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Housing provision through the vertical extension of existing buildings offers opportunity to achieve this, reducing embodied carbon emissions and creating more efficient high-density settlements. In England, permitted development (PD) rights allow for residential vertical extensions without the requirement for conventional planning permission. Despite this, and due to limited uptake of PD rights and a lack of existing studies, the potential for housing provision through widespread extension is unknown. This paper develops a framework to assess the ability of vertical extensions in providing housing at different scales and applies this to Sheffield, England. The generation of new dwellings through PD vertical extension could house up to 175,000 in Sheffield, with detached buildings and those in residential use being most suited to extension. PD rights favour the enlargement of existing dwellings over the generation of new residential units, potentially limiting their effectiveness in tackling the housing crisis.

T1  - Demolish or reuse? – The balance between operational and embodied emissions in the retrofit of commercial buildings
AN  - 2714739262
AB  - There are two clear options for reducing the emissions of poorly-performing buildings: refurbishment of the space to a higher standard or demolition and replacement with a better performing building. Non-residential buildings are subject to the latter of these options more than dwellings due to higher rates of ownership changes. This study assesses the carbon emissions of each of the above options for a poorly-performing retail building in Sheffield, UK. The embodied carbon and operational performance of each scenario are calculated to identify the most sustainable option over a 50 year lifespan. The scenario with the lowest emissions is found to be a retrofit case study relying upon electricity as its sole fuel source. The new build scenarios emitted significantly more carbon over the building’s lifespan despite performing better operationally than the refurbishment scenario. It was also found that, due to the decarbonisation of the national grid, relying on gas boilers instead of electric fuel sources would make carbon emissions approximately 2.5x bigger in the refurbishment model, despite being legal under UK building regulations.

T1  - Use of a high-volume prescription database to explore health inequalities in England: assessing impacts of social deprivation and temperature on the prescription volume of medicines
AN  - 2705907123
AB  - AimSocial inequalities are widened by climate change, which increases extreme temperature events that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable people. While the diseases impacted have been reviewed in the literature, how this reflects upon pharmaceutical consumption remains unknown. We assess that effect on a panel of the most prescribed drug classes in terms of volume in the National Health Service (NHS) database.Subject and methodsA retrospective econometric analysis of NHS prescription data was carried out, focusing on antibiotics, antidepressants and bronchodilators (drugs associated to priority diseases in addition to being among the most prescribed ones) between 2011 and 2018. Data linkage enabled prescriptions to be related to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) and temperature data. The analysis was then undertaken at lower layer super output areas (LSOAs) level, using fixed-effect negative binomial regression models.ResultsOur results show that prescription rates were higher across the most deprived LSOAs, even after adjusting for the associated disease DALYs. In addition, prescription volume also progressively increased under colder temperatures below 15 °C, with an exacerbated effect in the most deprived areas.ConclusionTherefore, health inequalities in England affect prescription volumes, with higher levels in the most deprived areas which are not fully explained by morbidity differences. Lowest temperature conditions appear to intensify vulnerabilities while hot temperatures do not increase these differences in terms of prescriptions. Populations residing in the most deprived LSOAs could be more sensitive to environmental variables, leading to higher consumption of medicine under cold temperature and increased air pollution.

T1  - Downscaling population and urban land use for socio-economic scenarios in the UK
AN  - 2705543637
AB  - Abstract Projecting the distribution of population is critical in supporting analysis of the impacts and risks associated with climate change. In this paper, we apply a computational algorithm parameterised for the UK Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (UK-SSP) narratives to create 1-km gridded urban land use and population projections for the UK to the end of the twenty-first century. Using a unimodal neighbourhood function, we model heterogeneity in urban sprawl patterns. The urban land use maps are used as weights to create downscaled population projections. We undertake a model uncertainty analysis using 500 simulations with varying parameter settings per UK-SSP. Results illustrate how sprawl can emerge from scenario conditions even when population numbers decline, and irrespective of socio-economic wellbeing. To avoid negative environmental externalities associated with uncontrolled sprawl, such as in UK-SSP5 and UK-SSP3, planning policies will be vital. Uncertainties about future population development in the UK are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. This has an effect on the competition for land and influences confidence in projections of broader land system change.

T1  - Climate change allowances, non‐stationarity and flood frequency analyses
AN  - 2702434238
AB  - When considering future adaptation to climate change in UK fluvial flood alleviation schemes, the current recommendation by the Environment Agency (England) is to increase peak design flood flows by a preselected percentage. This allowance varies depending on the period for which the estimate is being made, the vulnerability of the development being considered and its location. Recently, questions have been raised as to whether these percentage uplifts should be kept the same, or whether change has already happened within the baseline period and so uplifts should be reduced. A complicating factor is that changes in flood frequency can occur for reasons in addition to climate change, such as land‐use change or natural variability. This article describes current approaches taken by different stakeholders for catchments in England and Wales to account for climate change, and discusses these allowances where there is already an observed presence of trend in flood regimes. Theil–Sen estimators of trend were used in comparing non‐stationary and stationary flood frequency curves with allowances applied, leading to a recommendation of evaluating non‐stationary models at 1990, the end of the reference period. Examples were explored such as the Eden catchment, which was heavily affected by Storm Desmond in December 2015.

T1  - Spatial targeting of nature‐based solutions for flood risk management within river catchments
AN  - 2702434161
AB  - A wide range of nature‐based solutions for flood hazard management work by storing and slowing flow within catchments, and therefore, there is a need to identify the optimal locations for implementing these solutions. This paper presents a relative scoring‐based mapping of the likely locations that contribute to the flood peak. Targeting flow reduction and attenuating mitigation actions in these locations can be an effective way to reduce flood damages at impact points downstream. The presented tool, SCIMAP‐Flood, uses information on land cover, hydrological connectivity, flood generating rainfall patterns and hydrological travel time distributions to impacted communities to find the potential source areas of flood waters. The importance of each location in the catchment is weighted based on its contribution to the flood hazard at each of the downstream impact points. In the example application, SCIMAP‐Flood is applied at a 5‐m grid resolution for the River Eden catchment, Cumbria, England, to provide sub‐field scale information at the landscape extent. Therefore, the tool can identify sub‐catchments where more detailed work can test different mitigation measures.

T1  - Can liberalised electricity markets deliver on climate change and energy poverty? Evidence from community projects in Great Britain
AN  - 2700530136
AB  - This paper reports on tensions between decarbonisation and energy poverty priorities in Great Britain’s liberalised electricity markets. Switching electricity suppliers in this market can result in significant benefits for those on bad deals. Further benefits are determined by the regulator. However, many of the energy poor lack the capabilities to switch and access these benefits. Community organisations play an important role in providing such access through remedial action. Using the capabilities approach, this paper combines quantitative and qualitative organisational data analysis at a community level to reveal an increasing share of the population who could benefit from switching and who agree to switching. At the same time, eligibility for one-off discounts on electricity bills to support the energy poor has increased sharply in recent years. This data points towards climate mitigation policies and market structures which benefit wealthier groups at the expense of more deprived groups who lack capabilities. At the micro scale, data access and intermediation at various levels and scales can help support more targeted interventions that facilitate well-being and enhanced capabilities. At the macro level, liberalised retail electricity markets need to be accommodated by safety nets and supportive institutional arrangements to avoid competitive pressures translating into complexity and opacity for consumers. Failure to equitably address capability conflicts, also framed as energy justice tensions and trade-offs, risks reinforcing and creating new injustices.

AN  - 2708720147
AB  - AimsThe provide insight into how humans are damaging our oceans, how changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate and why we need to be seriously worried.To show how human healthcare, as a big contributor can play a role to reduce this harm, help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and give humanity a future.MethodsI will present under the following headings:• Why must human healthcare must care about oceans (and big ships).• What oceans give us, what we return and why this imbalance must change.• The effects of carbon and pollution on oceanic health from the perspective of biomass, and photosynthetic capacity.• How the biosphere is interconnected and how ocean health directly related to human health and wellbeing.• The timelines for tipping points in ocean acidification and the consequences.The credibility for me presenting is based upon the fact I have worked in the area of sustainability for a number of years in the following capacity:• Co-chair of County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust’s Sustainability Development Group.• Member of Durham County Council’s Climate Emergency Strategic Board.• Member of The Northeast Integrated Care System Sustainability Group and ‘people’ workstream lead.• Trustee of the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare.• Member of the Intensive Care Societies Sustainability Working Group.• Member of NHS England’s Sustainable Procurement Forum.• Member of NHS England’s Sustainable Supplier Forum.• Co-founder of HealthCare Ocean.• Member of the UK National Committee for the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.I an active in all the groups above. I am lucky my children are in Uni and my wife very understanding !ResultsAt Healthcare Ocean, we are always focussed on actions as we know the problem. I therefore go on to talk about:• Healthcare and it’s suppliers: the size of the industry and the leverage it possesses to drive change.• How this change must come through the lens of human health and healthcare. How we can make trillion dollar industries appreciate the impact they are causing and how this will affect their health (despite it hitting the lower-resourced countries first).• How we can link big industry, healthcare providers and the suppliers of equipment, pharma and services through the common goal of improving oceanic and biosphere health.• How the changes will ultimately benefit everyone globally.• What the mechanisms are to deliver actions: the social value guidance, everygreen supplier framework, IMO guidance voluntarily adopted following education.• Who we network and work with to deliver changes in: the environmental impact of container ships which deliver healthcare goods, whale strike avoidance, reduction in healthcare orginating molecular pollution and water treatment options.• How we plan to reach out nationally and globally and educate on oceanic health.Abstract 321 Figure 1Carbonate based marine life survival against pH[Figure omitted. See PDF]ConclusionI will finish by showing what we have acheived so far through our collaboration with NHS England. What changes are coming which are a world first and how these can be scaled globally.For an example of our goals, please see www.healthcareocean.org

T1  - Energy demand reduction options for meeting national zero-emission targets in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2704124768
AB  - In recent years, global studies have attempted to understand the contribution that energy demand reduction could make to climate mitigation efforts. Here we develop a bottom-up, whole-system framework that comprehensively estimates the potential for energy demand reduction at a country level. Replicable for other countries, our framework is applied to the case of the United Kingdom where we find that reductions in energy demand of 52% by 2050 compared with 2020 levels are possible without compromising on citizens’ quality of life. This translates to annual energy demands of 40 GJ per person, compared with the current Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 116 GJ and the global average of 55 GJ. Our findings show that energy demand reduction can reduce reliance on high-risk carbon dioxide removal technologies, has moderate investment requirements and allows space for ratcheting up climate ambition. We conclude that national climate policy should increasingly develop and integrate energy demand reduction measures.Efforts to model the contribution of energy demand reductions towards climate targets typically focus at the global scale. Here, Barrett et al. develop an approach for understanding the country-level demand reduction potential and explore options for lowering final energy demand in the United Kingdom.

T1  - Reimagining research ethics to include environmental sustainability: a principled approach, including a case study of data-driven health research
AN  - 2703527262
AB  - In this paper we argue the need to reimagine research ethics frameworks to include notions of environmental sustainability. While there have long been calls for healthcare ethics frameworks and decision-making to include aspects of sustainability, less attention has focused on how research ethics frameworks could address this. To do this, we first describe the traditional approach to research ethics, which often relies on individualised notions of risk. We argue that we need to broaden this notion of individual risk to consider issues associated with environmental sustainability. This is because research is associated with carbon emissions and other environmental impacts, both of which cause climate change health hazards. We introduce how bioethics frameworks have considered notions of environmental sustainability and draw on these to help develop a framework suitable for researchers. We provide a case study of data-driven health research to apply our framework.

T1  - Genomic analysis of the rare British Lop pig and identification of distinctive genomic markers
AN  - 2701492813
AB  - Concentration of production on a few commercial pig breeds has led to the marginalization of many native, numerically small breeds, increasing their risk of endangerment. In the UK, one such rare breed is the British Lop, a lop-eared breed, of similar origin to the Welsh breed. The objective of the present study was to address the genomic status of the British Lop and its relationship with other breeds and identify a small set of genomic markers that uniquely characterize and distinguish British Lop animals. Results have shown that the British Lop is a relatively distinct population with reduced genomic diversity and effective size consistent with its status as a rare breed. Furthermore, we demonstrated the genetic closeness of the British Lop to phenotypically similar breeds such as Landrace and Welsh as well Large White, Middle White and Pietrain. Finally, a set of 75 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms distributed across multiple chromosomes were identified and validated as markers that can consistently distinguish British Lops from other closely related breeds. Results may inform breeding and management strategies aiming to enhance diversity as well as the development of a breed purity test.

T1  - Description and Evaluation of an Emission‐Driven and Fully Coupled Methane Cycle in UKESM1
AN  - 2792484606
AB  - Methane (CH4) is one of the most important trace gases in the atmosphere owing to its role as an exceedingly effective greenhouse gas and atmospheric pollutant. Better understanding of the global methane cycle and its interactions with the Earth system is therefore necessary for robust future projections of anthropogenic climate change and assessments of multi‐gas mitigation strategies. Here we present a newly developed methane emission‐driven Earth system model to simulate the global methane cycle fully interactively. We provide an evaluation of methane sources and sinks and a full‐cycle methane budget and its change over the historic period. We further evaluate the methane atmospheric abundance and lifetime against available observations. The new methane emission‐driven model simulates all the components of the methane cycle within observational uncertainty. We calculate a total present‐day (2000–2009 decadal average) methane source of 591 Tg(CH4) yr−1 with 197 Tg(CH4) yr−1 coming from wetlands. These sources are nearly balanced by the global methane sinks amounting to 580 Tg (CH4) yr−1; reaction of methane with the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere alone removes 525 Tg(CH4) yr−1. The imbalance between sources and sinks of 11 Tg(CH4) yr−1 represents the atmospheric methane growth rate and is in fairly good agreement with current best estimates of 5.8 Tg(CH4) yr−1 with a range of 4.9–6.6 Tg(CH4) yr−1. At present‐day the model shows a maximum systematic negative‐bias of approximately 200 ppb in the methane surface mole fraction.

T1  - Is the United Kingdom’s hydrogen strategy an effective low carbon strategy?
AN  - 2701113958
AB  - The United Kingdom’s (UK) clean energy shift to ensure low-carbon and affordable energy supply is regulated by the Energy Act 2013 and the electricity market reform programme. To further this energy shift and to reduce the UK’s dependence on natural gas as an energy source, the (UK) launched its Hydrogen Strategy on 17 August 2021. The rationale for the Strategy is that hydrogen gas is a clean and efficient source of fuel, there is an abundance of hydrogen and that changing from natural gas to hydrogen gas will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The question raised is whether the Government’s objective of the use of Hydrogen to replace natural gas is an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse emissions caused by heating. The scope of this paper does not include an examination of the role of the oil industry as an energy source. This paper will firstly explain how the UK came to be dependent on the use of natural gas by briefly outlining the history of its development as a form of energy in the UK. It will then focus on considering the advantages and disadvantages of the use of natural gas and of alternatives in the UK for heating. It will assess the efficacy of hydrogen as an alternative to the use of natural gas in the UK for providing energy for heating in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and therefore protecting the environment and the economy.

T1  - The botanical education extinction and the fall of plant awareness
AN  - 2695352691
AB  - Civilization is dependent upon plants for survival. Plants permeate our every moment and our relationship with them will dictate how we will manage the threats of climate change and ecological collapse defining the Anthropocene. Yet, despite the significance of plants and the critical role they have played in shaping ecosystems, civilizations, and human cultures, many people are now disconnected from the botanical world. Students are presented with little plant content, particularly identification, compared with animal content. Consequently, we are producing few plant scientists and educating fewer scientists about plants. This drives a self‐accelerating cycle we term the extinction of botanical education. A process of knowledge erosion, that in this instance contributes to our separation from the natural world, makes us blind to the biodiversity crisis and inhibits our ability to restore it. We argue that neglecting the importance of plants within education threatens the foundations of industries and professions that rely on this knowledge. Furthermore, this extinction of botanical education creates an existential threat: Without the skills to fully comprehend the scale of and solutions to human‐induced global change, how do we as a society combat it? We present key research agendas that will enable us to reverse the extinction of botanical education and highlight the critical role plants play on the global stage.

T1  - The Public Law Paradoxes of Climate Emergency Declarations
AN  - 2688524040
AB  - Climate emergency declarations occupy a legally ambiguous space between emergency measure and political rhetoric. Their uncertain status in public law provides a unique opportunity to illuminate latent assumptions about emergencies and how they are regulated in law. This article analyzes climate emergency declarations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Aotearoa/New Zealand. It argues that these climate emergency declarations reflect back a set of paradoxes about the legal regulation of emergencies – paradoxes about defining the emergency, how time regulates and contains emergency power, and who gets to respond to the emergency and how. These paradoxes challenge long-held and over-simplified assumptions about emergencies and allow us to see the complex ways in which public law regulates emergencies – a necessity in a climate-disrupted world.

T1  - Grid-based simulation of soil moisture in the UK: future changes in extremes and wetting and drying dates
AN  - 2684609234
AB  - Soil moisture, typically defined as the amount of water in the unsaturated soil layer, is a central component of the hydrological cycle. The potential impacts of climate change on soil moisture have been less specifically studied than those on river flows, despite soil moisture deficits/excesses being a factor in a range of natural hazards, as well as having obvious importance for agriculture. Here, 1 km grids of monthly mean soil moisture content are simulated using a national-scale grid-based hydrological model, more typically applied to look at changes in river flows across Britain. A comparison of the soil moisture estimates from an observation-based simulation, with soil moisture deficit data from an operational system developed by the UK Met Office (Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System; MORECS), shows relatively good correspondence in soil drying and wetting dates, and in the month when soils are driest. The UK Climate Projections 2018 Regional projections are then used to drive the hydrological model, to investigate changes in occurrence of indicative soil moisture extremes and changes in typical wetting and drying dates of soils across the country. Analyses comparing baseline (December 1981–November 2011) and future (December 2050–November 2080) time-slices suggest large increases in the spatial occurrence of low soil moisture levels, along with later soil wetting dates, although changes to soil drying dates are less clear. Such information on potential future changes in soil moisture is important to enable the development of appropriate adaptation strategies for a range of sectors vulnerable to soil moisture levels.

T1  - Carbon storage and sequestration rates of trees inside and outside forests in Great Britain
AN  - 2676594542
AB  - Efforts to abate climate change heavily rely on carbon sequestration by trees. However, analyses of tree carbon dynamics often neglect trees outside of forests (TOFs) and spatially detailed information about tree carbon sequestration rates are largely missing. Here we describe a new method which combines remote sensing with forest inventory data from 127 358 sites to first estimate tree age and site productivity, which we then used to estimate carbon storage and sequestration rates for all trees inside and outside forests across Great Britain. Our models estimate carbon storage and sequestration rates with R2 values of 0.86 and 0.56 (root-mean-square errors of 70 tCO2e ha−1 and 3.4 tCO2e ha−1 yr−1). They also reveal the important finding that 17% (165.6 MtCO2e) of the total carbon storage and 21% (3.4 MtCO2e yr−1) of the total carbon sequestration rate of all trees in Great Britain come from TOF, with particularly high contributions in England (24.3% and 34.1%), followed by Wales (12.5% and 17.6%) and Scotland (2.6% and 1.8%). Future estimates of carbon status and fluxes need to account for the significant contributions of TOF because these trees, often found in field margins and hedgerows are potentially an important carbon offset. Our novel approach enables carbon baseline assessments against which changes can be assessed at management relevant scales, improving the means to measure progress towards net zero emissions targets and associated environmental policies.

T1  - THE ACCELERATION OF INEQUALITY RESEARCH
AN  - 2680630744
AB  - More than two-thirds of countries are experiencing increased income disparity, which exacerbates the risks of divisions and hampers economic and social development, according to the United Nations World Social Report 2020 (see go.nature.com/3hpyjkw).

Demography has long been studied by sociologists, but migration is now influenced heavily by natural resources and climate change.

Henriques's research will identify when it is relevant to include race in research data, how best to categorize human populations beyond race and ethnicity and how to make the benefits ofgenomics and health research equitable.

[...]in international forest ecology research, which has conventionally focused on natural resources, it can be "hard for researchers to acknowledge that their knowledge, as is everyone's, is rooted in their unique contexts".

Current flood forecasts are generally based on historical measurements of environmental variables at monitoring stations. In recent years, in addition to traditional data sources, large amounts of information related to floods have been made available via social media. Members of the public are constantly and promptly posting information and updates on local environmental phenomena on social media platforms. Despite the growing interest of scholars towards the usage of online data during natural disasters, the majority of studies focus exclusively on social media as a stand-alone data source, while its joint use with other type of information is still unexplored. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by integrating traditional historical information on floods with data extracted by Twitter and Google Trends. Our methodology is based on vine copulas, that allow us to capture the dependence structure among the marginals, which are modelled via appropriate time series methods, in a very flexible way. We apply our methodology to data related to three different coastal locations on the South coast of the United Kingdom (UK). The results show that our approach, based on the integration of social media data, outperforms traditional methods in terms of evaluation and prediction of flood events.

T1  - Neoliberal Citizenship:&nbsp;Sacred Markets, Sacrificial Lives
AN  - 2629085299
AB  - With cosmopolitan illusions put to rest, Europe is now haunted by a pervasive neoliberal transformation of citizenship that subordinates inclusion, protection, and belonging to rationalities of value. Against the backdrop of four major crises - Eurozone, refugee, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic - this book explores how neoliberal citizenship rewrites identities and solidarities in economic terms. The result is a sacralized market order in which those superfluous toeconomic needs and regarded as unproductive consumers of resources - be they undocumented migrants, debased citizens of austerity, or the elderly in care homes - are excluded and sacrificed for the well-being of the economy. Pushing biopolitical theorizing in novel directions through aninvestigation of the political economy of scarcity and the theology of the market, Neoliberal Citizenship reveals how a common thread connects the suspension of search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean, the punitive bailout of Greece, the widespread adoption of austerity measures, the normalization of racism, the celebration of resilience, and the fact that in Europe and North America, during the first wave of the pandemic, almost half of all COVID-19 deaths were care homeresidents. This thread is the sacralization of the market that, by making life conditional upon its economic and emotional value, turns 'less valuable' individuals into sacrificial subjects. Neoliberal Citizenship challenges established understandings of citizenship, brings to light new regimes of inclusion andexclusion, and advances critical insights on the future of neoliberalism in a post-COVID-19 world.

T1  - Emissions of NOx from blending of hydrogen and natural gas in space heating boilers
AN  - 2738664899
AB  - As part of climate change commitments, the United Kingdom is considering an incremental transition from natural gas to hydrogen for domestic heating, blending up to 20% of hydrogen (by volume) into the national gas network. We consider the possible impacts of this policy on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, a minor waste by-product from combustion. A meta-analysis of changes in NOx emissions from hydrogen/natural gas blends used in gas burners is undertaken, with focus on mixtures between 5% and 20% v/v. Literature reports are highly variable: for a 5% hydrogen blend, changes in NOx emissions, when compared to burning pure natural gas, vary over the range –12% to +39%, with a mean change across 14 studies of +8%. These estimates required an important assumption to be made that, when not explicitly described, all literature data on changes in NOx emissions and/or concentrations were suitably corrected for the reduced energy density and heat output arising once hydrogen is added. A NOx increase can be rationalized through the increased adiabatic flame temperature generated from hydrogen combustion. The associated range of plausible damage costs of a 5% hydrogen blend is estimated to fall within the range –117 million GBP to +362 million GBP per year; 20% hydrogen (the maximum that could be accommodated with existing infrastructure) would lead to a change in emissions in the range –50 to +154% with a change in damage costs of between –467 million GBP and +1,146 million GBP per year. The mean change is estimated at 292 million GBP per year. For existing poor performing boilers, an economic case can be made for scrappage and replacement based primarily on NOx damage costs avoided. The response of older boilers to added hydrogen is a critical evidence gap that needs filling before further decisions on hydrogen as a heating fuel are made.

T1  - Potential Co‐benefits and trade‐offs between improved soil management, climate change mitigation and agri‐food productivity
AN  - 2672233083
AB  - Maximising resource‐use efficiency, productivity and environmental sustainability are all fundamental requirements to raise global food production by ~70 per cent in order to feed a world population of ~9.7 billion people by 2050. Perhaps the most vital resource within our capacity to achieve this goal is our soil. Broadly, the fundamental question concerns whether or not satisfying this production demand will accelerate soil degradation, climate change, and the loss of soil carbon stocks. This paper builds upon the outputs of the UK Charity ‘Food & Farming Futures’ (chaired by Lord Curry of Kirkharle) virtual workshop held on 23 March 2021, entitled ‘Capturing the Potential of Soil’. The event focussed on the link between soil health, primarily soil organic carbon (SOC), and agricultural productivity. Supported with commentaries by Professor Pete Smith (University of Aberdeen and Science Director of the Scottish Climate Change Centre of Expertise) and Professor Steve McGrath (Head of Sustainable Agricultural Sciences at Rothamsted Research), specific focus will be given to the research challenges within the UK’s ability to improve soil health and functionality, the implementation priorities that must be held in order to improve soil management by 2050 and what the potential co‐benefits could be. These co‐benefits were scattered across environmental, economic, social and political issues, yet they may be summarised into six primary co‐benefits: developing natural capital, climate change mitigation, carbon trading, improvements in crop yield, animal performance and human health (nutrition). Additionally, the main barriers to improved soil management practices are centred on knowledge exchange‐regarding agri‐environmental techniques—whilst the most impactful solutions rely on soil monitoring, reporting and verification.

T1  - Inference for epidemic models with time-varying infection rates: Tracking the dynamics of oak processionary moth in the UK
AN  - 2669881055
AB  - Invasive pests pose a great threat to forest, woodland, and urban tree ecosystems. The oak processionary moth (OPM) is a destructive pest of oak trees, first reported in the UK in 2006. Despite great efforts to contain the outbreak within the original infested area of South-East England, OPM continues to spread.Here, we analyze data consisting of the numbers of OPM nests removed each year from two parks in London between 2013 and 2020. Using a state-of-the-art Bayesian inference scheme, we estimate the parameters for a stochastic compartmental SIR (susceptible, infested, and removed) model with a time-varying infestation rate to describe the spread of OPM.We find that the infestation rate and subsequent basic reproduction number have remained constant since 2013 (with R0 between one and two). This shows further controls must be taken to reduce R0 below one and stop the advance of OPM into other areas of England.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of the SIR model to describing OPM spread and show that further controls are needed to reduce the infestation rate. The proposed statistical methodology is a powerful tool to explore the nature of a time-varying infestation rate, applicable to other partially observed time series epidemic data.

T1  - Substantial carbon drawdown potential from enhanced rock weathering in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2662181000
AB  - Achieving national targets for net-zero carbon emissions will require atmospheric carbon dioxide removal strategies compatible with rising agricultural production. One possible method for delivering on these goals is enhanced rock weathering, which involves modifying soils with crushed silicate rocks, such as basalt. Here we use dynamic carbon budget modelling to assess the carbon dioxide removal potential and agricultural benefits of implementing enhanced rock weathering strategies across UK arable croplands. We find that enhanced rock weathering could deliver net carbon dioxide removal of 6–30 MtCO2 yr−1 for the United Kingdom by 2050, representing up to 45% of the atmospheric carbon removal required nationally to meet net-zero emissions. This suggests that enhanced rock weathering could play a crucial role in national climate mitigation strategies if it were to gain acceptance across national political, local community and farm scales. We show that it is feasible to eliminate the energy-demanding requirement for milling rocks to fine particle sizes. Co-benefits of enhanced rock weathering include substantial mitigation of nitrous oxide, the third most important greenhouse gas, widespread reversal of soil acidification and considerable cost savings from reduced fertilizer usage. Our analyses provide a guide for other nations to pursue their carbon dioxide removal ambitions and decarbonize agriculture—a key source of greenhouse gases.Enhancing rock weathering across UK croplands could deliver substantial atmospheric carbon dioxide removal alongside agricultural co-benefits, according to coupled climate–carbon–nitrogen cycle model simulations.

T1  - Extreme windstorms and sting jets in convection-permitting climate simulations over Europe
AN  - 2656970512
AB  - Extra-tropical windstorms are one of the costliest natural hazards affecting Europe, and windstorms that develop a sting jet are extremely damaging. A sting jet is a mesoscale core of very high wind speeds that occurs in Shapiro–Keyser type cyclones, and high-resolution models are required to adequately model sting jets. Here, we develop a low-cost methodology to automatically detect sting jets, using the characteristic warm seclusion of Shapiro–Keyser cyclones and the slantwise descent of high wind speeds, within pan-European 2.2 km convection-permitting climate model (CPM) simulations. The representation of wind gusts is improved with respect to ERA-Interim reanalysis data compared to observations; this is linked to better representation of cold conveyor belts and sting jets in the CPM. Our analysis indicates that Shapiro–Keyser cyclones, and those that develop sting jets, are the most damaging windstorms in present and future climates. The frequency of extreme windstorms is projected to increase by 2100 and a large contribution comes from sting jet storms. Furthermore, extreme wind speeds and their future changes are underestimated in the global climate model (GCM) compared to the CPM. We conclude that the CPM adds value in the representation of extreme winds and surface wind gusts and can provide improved input for impact models compared to coarser resolution models.

T1  - Can “sin industries” prove their legitimacy through CSR reporting? A study of UK tobacco and gambling companies
AN  - 2645736246
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this study is to examine the ways that sin industry companies attempt to utilise CSR reporting for legitimation.Design/methodology/approach>Conventional and summative content analyses were carried out on annual CSR reports in UK tobacco and gambling companies, juxtaposed against analysis of the actual behaviour of the companies, collectively and individually.Findings>The paper concludes that there is an ongoing tension between the business of sin industry companies and their attempts to establish and maintain any legitimacy, using CSR reporting in particular ways to try to prove their credentials to society and to engage salient stakeholder support. Ultimately, they aim to give themselves the scope for strategic choice to enable survival and financial flourishing.Research limitations/implications>Further research on CSR on other sin industries and in other jurisdictions with different regulatory situations could shed further light on the achievement or denial of different types of legitimacy. Studying different time periods as industries change would be of value.Practical implications>On a practical basis, the study offers guidelines to stakeholders on the use of CSR reports from sin companies, and suggests the establishment of objective external CSR reports, overseen by accounting regulators.Social implications>The paper provides an overview of the role of sin industries in society, and mitigating their harms.Originality/value>This study allowed for a comprehensive, dynamic and inclusive understanding of the interplay of CSR reporting and legitimacy by addressing conflicting interests between sin companies' social effects and inherent activities at the industry level. The methodology of multiple case study design in two sin industries combined content analysis of CSR reports, juxtaposed against analysis of behaviour in context. Previous research included the juxtaposition of actuality in analysis of only single case studies or particular issues. Thus, this research allows for a broader industry understanding. On a practical basis, the study offers guidelines to stakeholders on the use of CSR reports from sin companies, and suggests the establishment of objective external CSR reports, overseen by accounting regulators. At the social level, the paper provides an overview of sin industries in society, and mitigating their harms.

T1  - Moving in the Renaissance: The Rhetorical Ecologies of John Stow's Survey of London and Ben Jonson's "Foot Voyage"
AN  - 2811274346
AB  - Critical phenomenologies of space and sensation often represent them as forms of popular liberation because they draw from the modernist theories of Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau. However, a historical phenomenology of movement through space in two early modern period's walking texts—as rhetorical ecologies—reveal public spaces and their sensations as controversial and uncanny landscapes bound by historical and cultural practice. This analysis employs John Stow's 1598 Survey of London and the recently discovered 1618 "Foot Voyage" of Ben Jonson from London to Edinburgh as case studies for phenomenal experiences of space in Renaissance cultural history.

T1  - Energy transition in the UKCS – Modelling the effects of carbon emission charges on upstream petroleum operations
AN  - 2695094076
AB  - The UK has ambitious decarbonisation, climate change mitigation and energy transition goals. The upstream petroleum sector in the UK shares in these goals, as evidenced by its North Sea Transition Deal and as set out in its sector 'Roadmap 2035' for emissions reduction. Participation in an emissions trading scheme as a mechanism for achieving these goals is a key strategy identified in the sector roadmap. Currently, only qualifying installations in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) are charged for their emissions. Notwithstanding, prudent non-qualifying operators are also now incorporating these charges in their financial models for asset valuation purposes. This paper uses a recently updated database of 21 new UKCS fields to examine the effects of carbon emission charges on upstream petroleum operations in the province. We find that emission charges increase operating expenditures, which results (1) an acceleration of the timing of the economic limit of fields, leading to significantly lower petroleum production and carbon emissions; and (2) a reduction in the economic value of petroleum fields hence diminishing the competitiveness of the UKCS. These outcomes advance the energy transition cause of the UK. However, they give rise to major implications for the UK, including energy security, jobs, risk of exposure to a carbon leakage situation, and so on. We advocate a 'just transition' approach to energy transition, where petroleum production in the UKCS progresses but with a carbon footprint that is reduced and consistent with an economic optimum.

T1  - Business, Government and Policy‐making Capacity: UK Energy and Net Zero Transitions
AN  - 2672336193
AB  - The UK government is responsible for meeting legally binding decarbonisation objectives, but it is not on track to meet its next Climate Change Act targets or the goal of Net Zero by 2050. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report is a stark reminder of the importance of all countries, particularly those historically responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, devising and implementing the innovative and just policy solutions required to lower emissions. Within this context, this article explores the UK's sustainable energy policy making, and why it is not on course to meet targets, through the lens of government‐business relations. It analyses government policy capacity, incumbent energy company influence, and how complex relations and dependencies have affected sustainable policy (non‐)decisions and outcomes. It reveals that an over‐reliance on incumbent energy companies in UK energy politics, although understandable given the need to provide affordable and secure energy, has contributed towards insufficient space for cheaper and more just clean energy solutions.

T1  - Nitrogen cycle impacts on CO2 fertilisation and climate forcing of land carbon stores
AN  - 2652629026
AB  - Anthropogenic fossil fuel burning increases atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, which is adjusting the climate system. The direct impact of rising CO2 levels and climate feedback alters the terrestrial carbon stores. Land stores are presently increasing, offsetting a substantial fraction of CO2 emissions. Less understood is how this human-induced carbon cycle perturbation interacts with other terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. These connections require quantification, as they may eventually suppress land fertilisation, and so fewer emissions are allowed to follow any prescribed future global warming pathway. Using the new Joint UK Land Environment Simulator-CN large-scale land model, which contributed to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 as the land component of the UK Earth System Model v1 climate model, we focus on how the introduction of the simulated terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle modulates the expected evolution of vegetation and soil carbon pools. We find that the N-cycle suppresses, by approximately one-third, any future gains by the global soil pool when compared to calculations without that cycle. There is also a decrease in the vegetation carbon gain, although this is much smaller. Factorial simulations illustrate that N suppression tracks direct CO2 rise rather than climate change. The finding that this CO2-related effect predominantly influences soil carbon rather than vegetation carbon, we explain by different balances between changing carbon uptake levels and residence times. Finally, we discuss how this new generation of land models may gain further from emerging point knowledge held by the detailed ecological modelling community.

T1  - CLIMATE INJUSTICES DUE TO THE UNEQUAL AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
AN  - 2670468837
AB  - Climate change is ravaging the whole world, but the poor vulnerable developing countries are the hardest hit even though they are not primarily responsible for the massive greenhouse gases emissions causing global warming and climate change. This is tantamount to climate injustice as they are being impacted severely and have limited capacity to mitigate or adapt to the changing climate. Consequently, there is a need to share the burdens of climate change equally and equitably without discrimination. This paper submits that the developed industrialized rich countries are primarily responsible for climate change due to their massive emissions of greenhouse gases because of their industrial activities. Of note, most of the equipment and machineries used for production and other activities in these countries, utilized fossil fuel and emit greenhouse gases in the process. As such, justice demands that they have to be responsible for providing adaptation and mitigation measures to the developed countries through the mechanisms provided and set out in all international law instruments and agreements reached at the various Conferences of the Parties (COPs). A proportion of the monies and revenue received from the activities resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases are to be allocated to developing countries for adaptation and mitigation of climate change for them to be able to have clean environment, wellbeing, and sustainable livelihood. More importantly, it is imperative to transit to zero emissions globally this can be made possible using renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuel. The international communities should therefore improve their strategies and effectiveness regarding the implementation of all the treaty agreements on zero-emission to attain climate justice for all.

T1  - Using expert-elicitation to deliver biodiversity monitoring priorities on a Mediterranean island
AN  - 2642871534
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring plays an essential role in tracking changes in ecosystems, species distributions and abundances across the globe. Data collected through both structured and unstructured biodiversity recording can inform conservation measures designed to reduce, prevent, and reverse declines in valued biodiversity of many types. However, given that resources for biodiversity monitoring are limited, it is important that funding bodies prioritise investments relative to the requirements in any given region. We addressed this prioritisation requirement for a biodiverse Mediterranean island (Cyprus) using a three-stage process of expert-elicitation. This resulted in a structured list of twenty biodiversity monitoring needs; specifically, a hierarchy of three groups of these needs was created using a consensus approach. The most highly prioritised biodiversity monitoring needs were those related to the development of robust survey methodologies, and those ensuring that sufficiently skilled citizens are available to contribute. We discuss ways that the results of our expert-elicitation process could be used to support current and future biodiversity monitoring in Cyprus.

T1  - Non-linear response of temperature-related mortality risk to global warming in England and Wales
AN  - 2640007701
AB  - Climate change is expected to lead to changes in seasonal temperature-related mortality. However, this impact on health risk does not necessarily scale linearly with increasing temperature. By examining changes in risk relative to degrees of global warming, we show that there is a delayed emergence of the increase in summer mean mortality risk in England and Wales. Due to the relatively mild summer mean temperatures under the current climate and the non-linearity of the exposure–response relationships, minimal changes in summer mean risk are expected at lower levels of warming and an escalation in risk is projected beyond 2.5 °C of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels. In contrast, a 42% increase in mortality risk during summer heat extremes is already expected by 2 °C global warming. Winter attributable mortalities, on the other hand, are projected to decrease largely linearly with global warming in England and Wales.

AB  - Past and recent representations of the first industrial revolution As long ago as 1967, Marshal Hodgson recognized that the rise of Western economies could only be properly analysed and understood in a global context.1 Alas, the recommendation by this eminent scholar of Islam and the Islamicate world to re-conceptualize Britain’s Industrial Revolution within the wider spaces, longer chronologies and cultural frameworks of the long and interconnected history of Afro-Eurasia was not taken forward until Eric Jones published the first edition of the European Miracle in 1981.2 Since then, slowly but surely, books, articles and debates relocating and reconfiguring the industrialization of Britain and the West as another cycle in global economic history have proliferated and the subject has matured into a field that has revitalized scholarly interest in very long run structural developments on a global scale.

[...]industrialization can be parsimoniously encapsulated and graphically illustrated in statistical form as a conjuncture of accelerated economic transformation from an agrarian or organic to an industrial economy.

[...]following Kuznets, what the most recent wave of interpretations have observed and quantified is ‘structural change’ proceeding more or less rapidly until majorities of national workforces cease to be closely linked to, and dependent upon, primary production.

[...]a recognizable, explicable and unexceptional discontinuity in the history of a well-endowed island economy was transformed into a paradigm case for liberal and neo-liberal models of economic development.

In making that claim, however, the following argument does not denigrate the range of innovative economic achievements in the century which succeeded Britain’s decisive victory in the Seven Years’ War (1756–63).7 Rather, they were part-and-parcel of a conjuncture in British history, which witnessed a discernible acceleration in the rates of increase of real income per head and labour productivity due to structural changes in the domestic economy linked to urbanization and technical progress.8 Considered, as Hodgson advised, in the stream of world history, on all the indicators constructed and reconstructed by economic historians since the publication of Ashton’s classic study in 1948,9 the pace of transformation was rapid enough to carry the British polity to a position of economic superiority and geopolitical hegemony during the long Victorian boom (1846–73).

T1  - Alexander von Humboldt's Views of Nature: Colonial Conquests, Intra-European Conflicts, and the Indifference of Nature
AN  - 2813675915
AB  - This essay explores Alexander von Humboldt's Views of Nature (Ansichten der Natur). In this complex text, Humboldt endorses the European civilizing mission and shares some of its prejudices, but also criticizes the collateral damage that results from conquest and colonialism; he embraces the Enlightenment but acknowledges its dialectic; he recommends nature as the cure for civilizations in conflict, but recognizes that human cultures can also corrupt nature; and he offers comfort for the German nation even as he suggests that civilizations are ephemeral and nature is indifferent to their plight.

T1  - Strengthening the sustainability of European food chains through quality and procurement policies
AN  - 2636411570; IND607581765
AB  - The nexus of agri-food and sustainability in economic development has recently attracted the interest of policymakers, as global challenges like climate change and food security are revisited and reassessed. The critical role of food production in economic development has been emphasized through targeted agricultural quality policies. Many developed countries worldwide, including EU member states, have introduced food quality policies that could support sustainability. This paper combines knowledge obtained by several groups in a broad EU study and the reflections on policy-related results by EU-stakeholders, streamlined by a Delphi analysis. Current work presents research-based policy recommendations and statements on various quality schemes, introductory inferred from expert opinions throughout Europe, gauged through a modified policy Delphi framework. A roadmap of policy and practical proposals have been identified for all key stakeholders involved in these initiatives, implying the need to reshape the supply chain dynamics to continuously improve producers, processors, retailers, and consumers within the EU and definitively worldwide. Furthermore, implementing a holistic approach considering environmental and socio-economic features can improve the effectiveness of EU food quality policies.

T1  - The future distribution of wetland birds breeding in Europe validated against observed changes in distribution
AN  - 2635549298
AB  - Wetland bird species have been declining in population size worldwide as climate warming and land-use change affect their suitable habitats. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict changes in range dynamics for 64 non-passerine wetland birds breeding in Europe, including range size, position of centroid, and margins. We fitted the SDMs with data collected for the first European Breeding Bird Atlas and climate and land-use data to predict distributional changes over a century (the 1970s–2070s). The predicted annual changes were then compared to observed annual changes in range size and range centroid over a time period of 30 years using data from the second European Breeding Bird Atlas. Our models successfully predicted ca. 75% of the 64 bird species to contract their breeding range in the future, while the remaining species (mostly southerly breeding species) were predicted to expand their breeding ranges northward. The northern margins of southerly species and southern margins of northerly species, both, predicted to shift northward. Predicted changes in range size and shifts in range centroids were broadly positively associated with the observed changes, although some species deviated markedly from the predictions. The predicted average shift in core distributions was ca. 5 km yr−1 towards the north (5% northeast, 45% north, and 40% northwest), compared to a slower observed average shift of ca. 3.9 km yr−1. Predicted changes in range centroids were generally larger than observed changes, which suggests that bird distribution changes may lag behind environmental changes leading to ‘climate debt’. We suggest that predictions of SDMs should be viewed as qualitative rather than quantitative outcomes, indicating that care should be taken concerning single species. Still, our results highlight the urgent need for management actions such as wetland creation and restoration to improve wetland birds’ resilience to the expected environmental changes in the future.

T1  - Reconstructing Terrestrial Paleoclimates: A Comparison of the Co‐Existence Approach, Bayesian and Probability Reconstruction Techniques Using the UK Neogene
AN  - 2632116322
AB  - Neogene sediments in the UK are ideally situated for understanding the early development of hydrological dynamics and atmospheric circulation that led to the modern oceanic climate of northwest Europe. Onshore Neogene fossiliferous deposits in the UK are limited to the solution pipe fills at Trwyn y Parc in Anglesey (Middle Miocene), the Brassington Formation of Derbyshire (Serravallian‐Tortonian), and the Coralline Crag Formation (latest Zanclean‐earliest Piacenzian) and Red Crag Formation (Piacenzian‐Gelasian) in southeast England. Palynoflora from these localities can be used to provide snapshots into the climate at the time of deposition, however, palaeobotanical‐based reconstructions are typically lacking in their poor estimation of error. Therefore, we present the first pre‐Quaternary application of two terrestrial climate reconstruction techniques: CREST (Climate Reconstruction SofTware) and CRACLE (Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood Estimation), that use Bayesian and likelihood estimation probability respectively to generate a new palaeoclimate reconstruction, and compare this to Co‐existence Approach reconstructions from the UK and continental Europe. Our study shows how Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) declines by 3°–6°C, Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) declines by 480–600 mm and Precipitation Seasonality approximately halves throughout the Neogene. CREST and CRACLE reconstructions overlap with the Co‐exisence Approach and have the advantage of providing uncertainty, rather than ranges. The UK appears to have had a milder, wetter, and less seasonal climate than continental Europe. This is likely due to the buffering effects of the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea ameliorating the UK Neogene climate despite regional and global changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation.

T1  - Interaction of temperature, salinity and extracellular polymeric substances controls trace element incorporation into tufa calcite
AN  - 2627170024
AB  - The influence of extracellular polymeric substances on carbonate mineral growth in natural settings remains one of the most poorly understood contributors to the growth of non‐marine carbonate sediments. The influences of these materials are complicated by their association with living cells creating local microenvironments via metabolism and enzyme production, and by our uncertainty about the extracellular polymeric substances materials themselves. Different mixtures of extracellular polymeric substance molecules may behave in different ways, and differences in the local physical environment may alter how the mixtures influence mineral formation, and even result in different patterns of polymerization. Here, the influence of extracellular polymeric substances on calcite precipitation rate and Mg/Cacalcite in the absence of cells is investigated using extracts of extracellular polymeric substances from temperate fluvial tufa biofilm. The influence is complex, with the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances in solution altering deposition rate and trace element incorporation. Moreover, the results show interaction of the presence/absence of extracellular polymeric substances and both temperature and salinity. However, despite extracting extracellular polymeric substances from the same parent sample, a uniform influence was not found in these experiments, implying that the mixture is sufficiently variable within a sample for microenvironments within the biofilm to either promote or inhibit mineralization. As sedimentologists, we can no longer take the view that extracellular polymeric substances are a bystander material, or that they have a single set of coherent and predictable or intuitive influences. Rather, the emphasis must be on investigating the specific mixtures present in nature, and their complex and dynamic interaction with both mineral surfaces and hydrochemical conditions.

T1  - The impact of risk perceptions and belief in conspiracy theories on COVID-19 pandemic-related behaviours
AN  - 2626887138
AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories about the virus spread rapidly, and whilst governments across the globe put in place different restrictions and guidelines to contain the pandemic, these were not universally adhered to. This research examined the association between pandemic related risk perceptions, belief in conspiracy theories, and compliance with COVID-19 public guidelines amongst a UK sample (n = 368). Participants rated their level of concern for a series of potential risks during the pandemic (to the economy, personal health, freedom, media integrity and health risk to others). Participants also rated their level of belief in different conspiracy theories and self-reported their behaviour during the first UK lockdown. Mediational analyses showed that stronger belief in conspiracy theories was associated with perceptions of lower risk to health and higher risk to the economy and freedom, which in turn were associated with lower compliance with COVID-19 related governmental guidelines. Perception of information transparency risks did not mediate the association between belief in conspiracy theories and compliant behaviours. These results highlight the key role that risk perception may play in translating belief in conspiracy theories into low compliance with governmental COVID-19 related guidelines. Our findings suggest new patterns with respect to the relationship between conspiracy theory adherence and salience of different risk perceptions amidst the pandemic, which could have implications for the development of public health messaging and communication interventions.

T1  - Long-term population size and trends of South Georgia Shags (Leucocarbo [atriceps] georgianus) at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands and Bird Island, South Georgia
AN  - 2625647657
AB  - The South Georgia Shag Leucocarbo [atriceps] georgianus has breeding populations on the islands of South Georgia, the South Sandwich and South Orkney Islands. The South Orkney Islands are estimated to support ~ 18%–37% of the global population and South Georgia a further 37%–69%. Here, we examine changes in South Georgia Shag population size and productivity from Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, over a 43 year period (1978/1979 to 2020/2021) and from Bird Island, South Georgia, over a 32 year period (1989/1990 to 2020/2021). Analysis of total nesting pairs at Signy Island revealed an overall decline of 40.9% (− 1.3% per annum), with an increase during the 1980s, followed by a fluctuating decline from the 1990s to 2020/2021. Although the two Signy Island colonies showed correlated fluctuations in numbers of nesting pairs, over the whole time period these colonies showed markedly different population trajectories, indicating the limitations of using part-island counts to infer whole island trends, particularly given the low breeding-site fidelity in this species. Nest occupation in the larger colony (596 nests in 1978/1979) declined by 77.2% (− 3.5% per annum) whilst the smaller colony (50 nests in 1978/1979) exhibited an increase of 492% (+ 3.8% per annum). A decline in occupied nests of 58.3%, (− 2.8% per annum), has occurred in the Bird Island population since 1989/1990. Continuation of the significant decline in breeding numbers revealed in this study may be of important conservation concern, particularly as this trend has been mirrored at another site within the South Orkneys.

T1  - River science and flood risk management policy in England
AN  - 2625492830
AB  - We review the role of science in shaping river flood risk management policy in England, highlighting the relatively recent influence of fluvial geomorphology, river ecology, climate change and ecosystem services in evidence-based decision-making. These disciplines, together with an historical perspective, catchment-scale delivery, integrated land and water management planning, and adaptive management are crucial in managing future flood risk. A central tenet of previous land drainage policy was a professional (and public) mindset about flood ‘prevention’ solutions for river flooding. As a direct consequence, more than 8,500 km of rivers were ‘improved’ by mechanical dredging during the 1930s to 1980s; habitats were destroyed, but flooding continued. A more enlightened, long-term approach has since evolved in response to environmental imperatives and lessons learnt from several major floods during the last two ‘flood-rich’ decades. River science, local knowledge and land management incentives allow more natural processes to be restored in river catchments. The natural capital and ecosystem service benefits of river systems are now better understood and quantified, whereas the importance of sediment transport is fully recognised, with sources and sinks treated more holistically than in the past. Evaluating the outcomes of innovative runoff and river management techniques from both physical and socioeconomic perspectives will determine the success of a catchment-based approach. We highlight some of the uncertainties, nuances and assumptions associated with recent initiatives such as Natural Flood Management, Citizen Science and Flood Action Groups. Further integration between policy, strategic planning and local delivery is needed to anticipate and respond to climate and catchment land use changes. River science will play a crucial part in identifying the most effective way of improving flood management and in a way that helps to deliver the recovery of nature. It will inform adaptive management to cope with climate change.

T1  - Mainstreaming the Environment: Exploring pathways and narratives to improve policy and decision‐making
AN  - 2624068611
AB  - Mainstreaming is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary endeavour of normalising an idea from one policy domain into the decision‐making and routine activities of other policy domains necessary for effective delivery over the long term.The desire to mainstream springs from an increasing acceptance of the need for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to tackle key societal challenges such as climate change and biodiversity decline. Here, traditional policy and disciplinary silos are broken down to pursue and deliver more holistic interventions.This paper offers an additionality perspective to mainstreaming based on four questions. What is mainstreaming and what additionality does it offer for environmental policy and practice? What theoretical insights emerge from the mainstreaming and associated literatures? How can mainstreaming processes and outcomes be conceptualised and assessed? How can we improve future environmental mainstreaming pathways?Building from literatures focussed on mainstreaming and policy integration, we construct a framework and supporting narrative focussing on the lifecycle dynamics of mainstreaming pathways; a significant research gap. Their nonlinear progress is captured using theoretical adaptations of diffusion of innovation and sustainability, moving from initial innovation through to persuasion and to acceptance pathways, with progress dependent on the interplay and impacts of hooks and barriers and the degree of collaboration and system change pursued.Our narrative is further illuminated using natural capital and ecosystem services which reveal that while some progress has been made primarily through weaker mainstreaming pathways, current efforts are still focussed on ‘persuading’ stakeholders of the environment's value, rather than on initial framing and governance arrangements to maximise future impact.We conclude that the framing and development of natural capital and ecosystem services primarily in the environment and economic sectors has limited mainstreaming activity to wider audiences due to the lack of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches being pursued from the outset, including a more publicly and professionally accessible vocabulary and collaborative governance and decision‐making structures.We contend that our lifecycle narrative, with a focus on multiple pathways, hooks, barriers and collaboration makes a useful contribution to understanding mainstreaming dynamics and characteristics from which improved interventions can be developed.

T1  - Affective agencies of discomfort
AN  - 2811200651
AB  - How we might cultivate ethical and emancipatory modes of existence in hard places, places dominated by unequal and uneven social relations and far from any pristine environments to (re)connect with? This paper shows how learning with urban commoning projects in Paris and London has led to developing a more-than-human theorisation of discomfort. Although feelings of discomfort or unease are often acknowledged as central to collective projects, or in relation to the existential troubles of climate change, such perspectives are seldom examined together. Learning with commoning projects and bringing my ethnographic experiences in conversation with work on queer discomfort, critical social justice pedagogies and more-than-human geographies offers ways of thinking and doing with discomfort as collective practices. I suggest that (some) practices that welcome a careful attention to discomfort can cultivate relational worlds in the cracks of concrete environments. These are collective affective practices that involve ‘staying with discomfort’, a postponing of the tendency to swiftly reach towards a hopeful future in order to recover human and ecological ethical relations that have been obscured, dismissed or ridiculed, or indeed may not be possible.

This paper investigated the integration of ground source heat pumps and photovoltaic-thermal systems by modeling Matlab/Simulink to predict the systems' dynamic, electrical, and thermal behaviors. Two sites in Europe have been selected for the feasibility study, case 1 is in Rome (warm temperature climate), and case 2 is in Helsinki (snow climate). Building heating, cooling, and domestic hot water loads were estimated using models developed in EnergyPlus. The PV/T system was sized at 7kW with 22 panels installed on the roof area in both case studies. The GSHP system was sized at 4kW, determined by the square footage of the single house. A techno-economic-environmental study was performed to evaluate the potential benefits of this integrated renewable energy system, like energy-saving and environmental impact. The system's total energy for Rome was 7082.0 kWh/year and 5687.4 kWh/year for Helsinki. The results demonstrated that the integrated systems could supply 76.8% of Rome's single house energy demands and 43.0% of the energy demands for Helsinki.

AN  - 2787707016
AB  - Conference Title: 2022 7th International Conference on Environment Friendly Energies and Applications (EFEA)Conference Start Date:  2022,  Dec.  14 Conference End Date:  2022,  Dec.  16 Conference Location: Bagatelle Moka MU, MauritiusAs global CO2 emissions continue to rise, the demand for renewable and sustainable energy resources rises in conjunction. One such method for producing renewable energy is wind turbines, which convert kinetic energy into useful electrical energy. As the world's biggest offshore wind energy market, the UK has been investing in green energy to mitigate the impacts of climate change. As part of the 2050 vision for net-zero emissions, the UK aims to boost the total installed offshore capacity by four-fold to 40GW by 2030. The energy conversion efficiency is primarily determined by the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine blades. By optimising the blade design, the maximum attainable energy can be produced. Biomimetics may aid in this optimisation by emulating the Humpback whales flipper morphology for aerodynamic applications. It has been hypothesised that leading-edge tubercles can increase the post-stall lift and reduce the induced drag. This paper analyses the aerodynamic characteristics of a NACA-0021 aerofoil with leading-edge tubercles. The analysis is conducted in the Northumbria University low-speed wind tunnel, aiming to compare the tubercle aerofoil's pressure distribution, lift, and stall angle against the smooth aerofoil. The results indicate that leading-edge tubercle blades can enhance post-stall lift by 115%, thus indicating a reduction in induced drag in the post-stall region.

T1  - The Role of Green Infrastructure in Pluvial Flood Management and the Legislation Surrounding It: A Case Study in Bristol, UK
AN  - 2769921121
AB  - Surface water flooding is an issue which has required an increased level of addressment over the past two decades, with the methods used to combat flood events seeing an evolution. This evolution has been influenced heavily by multi-scale legislations and policies, which has pushed for more holistic methods for pluvial flood management. This review will analyse how Bristol City Council have implemented these multi-scale pieces and what has been put in place to encourage sustainable flood management. This will be done through a purposive review of the literature and an extensive review of legislation and policies on a national, European, and regional scale. The findings of the review were able to show that international legislation and policies are not in place to support sustainable management. UK policies, however, were more supportive, with direct reference and guidance for how to move away from hard engineering solutions. The City of Bristol has embraced the concept of sustainable flood management, with the highest level of support witnessed through the multi-scale review. Overall, the City of Bristol has achieved a good understanding of how to use sustainable drainage, with many systems throughout the city, and schemes to support the use. However, further legislative pieces need to be passed on a national and European scale to encourage and promote the deployment of these systems, so the benefits can be acquired on a large scale.

T1  - Hydrogen Purification by Pressure Swing Adsorption: High-Pressure PSA Performance in Recovery from Seasonal Storage
AN  - 2769914566
AB  - Hydrogen storage in a depleted gas field is a promising solution to the seasonal storage of renewable energy, a key question in Europe’s green transition. The gas composition and pressure in the month-long storage and recovery phase can vary substantially; meanwhile, the recovered H2 has to be pure, especially for fuel cell applications. Pressure swing adsorption can be used for the purification of the recovered gas. A lab-scale, four-bed PSA unit was built to investigate its applicability by separating different H2-CH4 mixtures. The feed parameters in the experiments are based on a depleted gas reservoir with a pressure range of 25–60 bar and methane contamination between 0 and 35%. The change in the feed properties is modeled by four distinct stages and the twelve-step cycle is tailored to each stage. The high pressure did not have any irreversible effects on the process. A hydrogen purity of 99.95% was achieved in all stages with the average hydrogen recovery ranging from 60 to 80%. The experiments revealed the challenges of a cycle design when the feed parameters are not constant, but an adequate separation performance was shown, which supports the applicability of the PSA in seasonal storage and confirms the need for further investigation with multicomponent contaminants and large-scale projects.

T1  - Understanding the Gap between University Ambitions to Teach and Deliver Climate Change Education
AN  - 2769913941
AB  - This paper aims to determine why there is a gap between university ambitions to teach climate change education, even where formal commitments and institutional incentives exist to encourage action. To explore this, acknowledgement of prior conceptual work is considered. A new matrix emerges, which conceptualizes the influences of organizational values, organisational culture, personal values and positionality-identity on the integration of climate change education into the curriculum. The role and influence of the researcher is addressed using an auto-ethnographic approach. A thematic analysis is applied to data collected from program leaders for an undergraduate curriculum review at a medium-sized university Business School, in north-west England. Five clusters are used to structure the results and explore the narrative, before applying these to the new matrix for illustrative purposes. The discussion suggests a lack of knowledge by staff or confusion over the communicated organizational values; an organizational culture that perceives sustainability and climate change are not priorities for the institution; and an attitude-behavior gap that can be attributed to personal values. In conclusion, organizational culture can be changed to increase the priority of sustainability and climate change through an objective in staff annual Personal Development Reviews, for example. Recommendations are made for further research.

T1  - Seeing Surveillance: Twenty Years of Surveillance & Society
AN  - 2761036421
AB  - This paper reflects on the development of surveillance studies over the twenty years since the first publication of Surveillance & Society. It starts by pointing to key contextual changes that have provided fertile ground for surveillance-focused analysis and, in turn, shaped the emphasis of the field. The main body of the paper is organised over three (temporal) frames: origins of the field, present considerations, and future concerns. In doing so, attention is given to the reproduction, development, and innovation of intellectual knowledge in the context of surveillance studies.

T1  - Sowing Seeds: Garden Festivals and the Remaking of British Cities after Deindustrialization
AN  - 2758388498
AB  - This article explores one of the strangest and most spectacular urban policies in postwar Britain: national garden festivals. Initiated by Margaret Thatcher's government, the festivals were vast state-sponsored gardening shows held in deindustrializing cities to reclaim derelict land for the property market. A festival was held every other year between 1984 and 1992 in a different city, five in all. The garden festivals showcased a new kind of urbanism, one that would change the ways that British cities related to nature, to capital, and to the wider world. First, they evinced a unique type of environmental politics—an implicit critique of urban industrial landscapes that was distinct from both the emerging critique of climate change and from older ideas about conservation. Second, they emerged at a time when the attraction of private capital was becoming increasingly central to urban regeneration. The festivals were at the forefront of this turn, outsourcing their events to corporate sponsors. Finally, the festivals offered an idiosyncratic, incoherent version of globalization. They courted a global pool of tourists and capital and invited delegations from across the world to plan events while, in many instances, reinforcing a preexisting racialized social hierarchy shaped by imperial legacies.

T1  - Behavioural Change as a Domestic Heat Pump Performance Driver: Insights on the Influence of Feedback Systems from Multiple Case Studies in the UK
AN  - 2756819579
AB  - Heat pumps (HPs) are seen as an increasingly important technology able to contribute significantly towards the decarbonisation of the domestic stock in the UK. However, there appears to be a performance gap between predicted and real-life HP performance, with several studies highlighting the need to include the HP’s interaction with users when examining their performance. This study examines the role of user behaviour in mitigating this performance gap from a systems perspective. A sample of 21 case studies was selected from 700 domestic HPs monitored across the UK via the government’s Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme for the collection of qualitative and quantitative socio-technical data. The application of systems thinking facilitated the identification of the underlying interactions between the HP system and its users. The systems analysis revealed that HP performance relies on complex socio-technical system interactions, including behavioural patterns, and that enabling feedback information processes can have a significant impact on user behaviour. The study enabled a deeper perspective on performance influencers relating to behavioural patterns and achieved new insights into the requirements for well-performing HPs. These findings have important implications for policy makers, installers and manufacturers of HP systems and their users.

T1  - Idealist Individualism or Indigenous Cosmology; Finding Entanglement across Species and Strata
AN  - 2756779372
AB  - Science and technology have been associated with modern Enlightenment, in a manner that elevated the rational mind over emotions and the body, a separation of the subjective mind from the object of observation, universal categories, objective observation, and linear causality. These assumptions, consolidated by Descartes and then Kant, have underpinned the philosophies of science, economics, policy, and political theory. They have shaped the modern world and enabled corporate freedom to exploit all ‘resources’ in the name of consumerism and global trade. Idealism has alienated subjective rationality from an idealised universal created world. In contrast, ancient indigenous ways of knowing are emerging as better exemplars of the interrelationship between individuals, communities, and organic and anorganic life forms. Celtic shapeshifters and praise poems forge an interwoven dance of geology, weather, plants, animals, and humanity with wisdom and politics. The Māori concept of whakapapa is the kin relations of everything, tied into complex claves as a taxonomy of familial ties. Animism was understood as pagan misidentification by modernity, but if the alienation set out by modern linear physics is severed, then the intra and inter-relationship of strata, atmosphere, ocean, and species are better relayed by indigenous philosophy than by outdated, colonial, modern assumptions. Celtic and Māori pantheism show us how entangled we are, and how special relationships are in place that last across generations.

T1  - Prospects for the Implementation of Underground Hydrogen Storage in the EU
AN  - 2756698519
AB  - The hydrogen economy is one of the possible directions of development for the European Union economy, which in the perspective of 2050, can ensure climate neutrality for the member states. The use of hydrogen in the economy on a larger scale requires the creation of a storage system. Due to the necessary volumes, the best sites for storage are geological structures (salt caverns, oil and gas deposits or aquifers). This article presents an analysis of prospects for large-scale underground hydrogen storage in geological structures. The political conditions for the implementation of the hydrogen economy in the EU Member States were analysed. The European Commission in its documents (e.g., Green Deal) indicates hydrogen as one of the important elements enabling the implementation of a climate-neutral economy. From the perspective of 2050, the analysis of changes and the forecast of energy consumption in the EU indicate an increase in electricity consumption. The expected increase in the production of energy from renewable sources may contribute to an increase in the production of hydrogen and its role in the economy. From the perspective of 2050, discussed gas should replace natural gas in the chemical, metallurgical and transport industries. In the longer term, the same process will also be observed in the aviation and maritime sectors. Growing charges for CO2 emissions will also contribute to the development of underground hydrogen storage technology. Geological conditions, especially wide-spread aquifers and salt deposits allow the development of underground hydrogen storage in Europe.

T1  - A Short Review on Thermoelectric Glazing for Sustainable Built Environment
AN  - 2756697680
AB  - Securing net-zero targets by employing sustainable materials for the built environment is highly desirable, and this can be achieved by retrofitting existing non-smart windows with thermoelectric (TE) glazing, providing improved thermal performance along with green electricity production. It is reported that TE glazing could produce ~4000 kWh of power per year in a cold climate with a temperature differential of ~22 °C. This feature of TE materials drives their emplacement as an alternative to existing glazing materials and could lead to the identification of optimum solutions for smart window development. However, few attempts have been made to employ TE materials in glazing. Therefore, in this brief review, we discuss, for the first time, the efforts made to employ TE in glazing, identify their drawbacks, and discuss potential solutions. Furthermore, the working principle, suitable materials, and methods for developing TE glazing are discussed. In addition, this article introduces a new research area and provides researchers with detailed instructions on how to build and optimize this system. The maximum efficiency of a thermoelectric material is determined by its thermoelectric figure of merit, which is a well-defined metric to characterize a device operating between the hot-side and cold-side temperatures. TE material’s figure of merit promises new perspectives on the conceivable future energy-positive built environment. The role of TE in tackling the energy crisis is also discussed, since it provides sustainable energy alternatives

T1  - Climate Change Is Driving Shifts in Dragonfly Species Richness across Europe via Differential Dynamics of Taxonomic and Biogeographic Groups
AN  - 2756682549
AB  - Understanding how changes in species richness pattern correlate with range changes in different taxonomic and biogeographic groups is important for conservation because it allows for generalizations about which species are at greatest risk. Here, we assessed whether changes in species richness patterns result from generalized range shifts across taxonomic and biogeographic groups or from changes in specific subsets of species. Using data from 1988 and from 2010, we studied changes in distributional range of European dragonfly species, using outline distribution maps for all dragonflies combined and separately for taxonomic suborders (Zygoptera and Anisoptera) and biogeographic groups (Boreo-alpine, Eurasian, Mediterranean, and Tropical). The results demonstrated differing range dynamics for Zygoptera and Anisoptera, with Anisoptera driving local turnover in species richness to a greater extent than Zygoptera. The distributional range of Tropical and Mediterranean species had expanded to a much greater extent than that of Eurasian and Boreo-alpine species. Large-scale changes in species richness arose from several divergent, group-specific processes. Overall, local diversity especially declined in parts of southern and south-eastern Europe, reflecting local losses in multiple species rather than major range contractions among Mediterranean or Eurasian species. In fact, among the biogeographic groups, overall range declines were most prominent among Boreo-alpine species, highlighting the particular threat from climate change to this group.

T1  - The Potential of Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPs) to Supply Net Zero Carbon Housing
AN  - 2756673270
AB  - Governments throughout the EU and the UK face a persistent challenge of satisfying the continual growth in demand for housing and create zero carbon buildings. This paper presents a novel conceptual framework and empirical results to evaluate the potential for Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPs) to address this challenge. Firstly, we present a comprehensive analysis of the energy performance of a SIPs building in the UK to evaluate the potential for such technologies to satisfy the energy and carbon objectives. Using our unique data set we show that SIPs can exceed the necessary energy efficiency standards and reach Net Zero Carbon. Secondly, we introduce game theory as a novel conceptual framework to understand the incentives of the manufacturers of SIPs and UK/EU authorities. This enables us to identify potential sources of incentive conflict, which inhibit the diffusion of such technologies. We demonstrate that it benefits both parties to engage in medium investment, but the inferior under investment scenario can emerge if the UK/EU does not provide leadership and commitment to SIPs technologies. Regardless of the market design in terms of the timing of decisions, the maximum level of support by both the UK/EU and the SIPs manufacturers cannot be achieved.

T1  - The Effects of Nitrogen Fertilisation on Plant Species Richness in European Permanent Grasslands: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2756655169
AB  - Nitrogen fertilisation is a common form of agricultural intensification, aimed at increasing biomass, which can affect plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of nitrogen fertilisation studies in European permanent grasslands, we asked: (i) what relationship form exists between nitrogen application rate and change in plant diversity, compared to zero fertilisation controls; and (ii) how grassland, management and study characteristics affect this relationship. Meta-analysis of 34 control-treatment effects from 14 studies conducted across nine European countries revealed a negative linear relationship between nitrogen fertilisation rate and change in plant species richness, equivalent to approximately 1.5 species/m2 lost for every 100 Kg ha−1 yr−1 of nitrogen added. Fertilisation induced reductions in plant species richness were greater when defoliation rates were lower. We found some evidence that grasslands with a higher baseline plant diversity lost more species when fertilised compared to more species poor grasslands, although uncertainty was high. Due to the diverse grassland types included in the analysis, the variability in fertilisation-driven changes in plant diversity was high. We identified several remaining limitations to our understanding, including uncertainty about non-linear effects, which could aid efforts to optimise the trade-off of plant diversity and increasing grassland yields.

T1  - Simultaneous saccharification and ethanologenic fermentation (SSF) of waste bread by an amylolytic Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius strain TM333
AN  - 2755774519
AB  - The starch in waste bread (WB) from industrial sandwich production was directly converted to ethanol by an amylolytic, ethanologenic thermophile (Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius strain TM333) under 5 different simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) regimes. Crude α-amylase from TM333 was used alone or in the presence of amyloglucosidase (AMG), a starch monomerizing enzyme used in industry, with/without prior gelatinisation/liquefaction treatments and P. thermoglucosidasius TM333 fermentation compared with Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a control. Results suggest that TM333 can ferment WB using SSF with yields of 94–100% of theoretical (based on all sugars in WB) in 48 h without the need for AMG addition or any form of heat pre-treatment. This indicates that TM333 can transport and ferment all of the malto-oligosaccharides generated by its α-amylase. In the yeast control experiments, addition of AMG together with the crude α-amylase was necessary for full fermentation over the same time period. This suggests that industrial fermentation of WB starch to bio-ethanol or other products using an enhanced amylolytic P. thermoglucosidasius strain could offer significant cost savings compared to alternatives requiring enzyme supplementation.

T1  - The Performance of Natural Flood Management at the Large Catchment-Scale: A Case Study in the Warwickshire Stour Valley
AN  - 2748564433
AB  - The limited understanding of Natural Flood Management (NFM) performance, especially at large hydrological scales, is considered a critical barrier for the further funding and implementation of these nature-based solutions to the increasing international problem of flooding. The publications of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report and Environment Agency’s National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy (NFCERMS) for England have shown that extreme weather, including increased likelihood of high magnitude flood events, will occur and will require more novel management methods. This study focused on the ability of co-designed NFM measures to ameliorate downstream fluvial flooding by attenuating catchment response through a highly spatially distributed network of attenuating and roughening measures. Performance was characterised by the ability of NFM to attenuate flood peaks at different spatial scales across a large (187 km2) dendritic catchment, including the lowering of flood peaks and delaying the time-to-peak. Using a coupled modelling methodology and applying it to the upper Stour Valley, Warwickshire-Avon, UK, a rural response to the application of a set of NFM interventions was developed using the hydrodynamic model Flood Modeller Pro and XPSWMM ©. The method demonstrated a means of incorporating local knowledge in a realistic set of NFM schemes, tested to multiple flood risk scenarios (including climate change). Under frequent, smaller design storm events (e.g., Index Flood (QMED) and 3.3% AEP), flood peaks were lowered across all hydrological scales tested (5.8 km2 to 187 km2). As the design flood event severity increases, impact from upstream NFM attenuation on downstream peak response diminished significantly, especially at the largest hydrological scales. However, even at the largest hydrological scale, delays in time-to-peak were noted, increasing the ability of downstream communities to respond and enact flood preparation activities, thus increasing resilience to potential flooding events. While the benefits were limited to large flood events, the modelling indicated that NFM has the potential to reduce downstream flood risk. However, greater integration of observed data to improve model confidence and reduce uncertainty in modelled events is needed, especially the uncertainty associated with using single peaked design storm events from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). This paper proposes a future Before–After Control–Impact (BACI) monitoring programme that could be integrated with models and applied across non-tidally influenced catchments seeking to empirically test the hydrological performance of in-situ NFM.

T1  - A Tariff Model for Reclaimed Water in Industrial Sectors: An Opportunity from the Circular Economy
AN  - 2748564431
AB  - The growth of the world’s population is associated with an increase in demand for water. The consequences of this increase are twofold: On the one hand, it endangers the water balance of the ecosystem, and on the other hand, it considerably increases the volume of wastewater generated. In this sense, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a fundamental role since their objective is to guarantee the quality of the effluents discharged into the environment. Moreover, current treatment systems allow for the subsequent use of the effluent. Thus, the wastewater treatment sector can be seen as an unconventional source of water, acquiring a special importance in the framework of the circular economy. In this context, water reclamation and reuse are identified as key components of water resource management. However, the economic aspects, in terms of tariff design and cost recovery, represent a major barrier to incentivizing its use. In this paper, the authors analyze these aspects and propose a tariff that combines the cost recovery, an incentive to use reclaimed water and other relevant aspects that guarantee the success of water reuse projects. With this objective, three industrial sectors are evaluated. For the first sector, the user industries would achieve a saving of approximately 10% by changing the consumption of conventional water to reclaimed water; in the second sector, they would achieve a saving of 18% and in the third sector a saving of approximately 16%. In addition to guaranteeing sustainability in the consumption of reclaimed water in industry, the viability of the supplying company is ensured. This research offers valuable results that will be useful for establishing future strategies aimed at encouraging the use of reclaimed water in industrial environments.

T1  - The Role of Runoff Attenuation Features (RAFs) in Natural Flood Management
AN  - 2748564293
AB  - Natural Flood Management (NFM) and catchment-based solutions for flood risk management and environmental problems are wide-ranging and complex. Management of fluvial flood risk in the UK is undergoing a fundamental shift, with a change in emphasis from solely working with structural defences to considering catchment-based measures which attenuate flood runoff. At the heart of this change are NFM and nature-based solutions. One key type of intervention is the Runoff Attenuation Feature (RAF): a class of features that targets runoff flow pathways and creates new temporary flow storage (such as ponds and leaky barriers). However, there is currently a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of NFM and RAFs at larger catchment scales and for managing extreme flood events. Nevertheless, there is a strong evidence base to suggest that well-designed RAFs deliver a range of ecosystem services if installed in the correct location. This paper reviews and critiques the role of RAFs and NFM as an interventionist and holistic approach to lowering runoff rates. The link between RAF design types and their relationship to land use and scale is made. Recent novel innovations and attempts to scale up RAFs are discussed. The role of antecedent conditions, groundwater and the change in residence time of processes is highlighted. The uncertainty and complexity of proving NFM effectiveness underpin a view that new thinking in catchment flood management is needed. New research is required, and many questions are raised about RAFs and NFM. The direction of travel is that a positive and proactive NFM community can now embrace the problem. Proof that RAFs and NFM can address flood management is not likely to be resolved without a great deal of further research but confidence that RAFs do beneficial work is growing and an argument for greater amounts of runoff attenuation is made.

T1  - Waste Management and the Perspective of a Green Hospital—A Systematic Narrative Review
AN  - 2748542211
AB  - The concept of a “green hospital” is used in reference to a hospital that includes the environment as part of its quality services and one that pays attention to the sustainable design of buildings. Waste disposal represents a potential risk for the environment; therefore, waste collection from healthcare centers is a key environmental issue. Our study aims to systematically review the experiences acquired in worldwide nosocomial settings related to the management of healthcare waste. Nineteen studies, selected between January 2020 and April 2022 on Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases were included in our systematic narrative review. Operating room and hemodialysis activities seem to be the procedures most associated with waste production. To deal with waste production, the 5Rs rule (reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink and research) was a common suggested strategy to derive the maximum practical benefit while generating the minimum amount of waste. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the greening process of nosocomial environments. Waste management requires a multifactorial approach to deal with medical waste management, even considering the climate change that the world is experiencing. Education of health personnel and managers, regulation by governmental institutions, creation of an “environmental greening team”, and awareness of stakeholders and policymakers are some of the measures needed for the greening of healthcare facilities.

T1  - FoodLink—A Network for Driving Food Transition in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area
AN  - 2748335519
AB  - The territory that currently corresponds to the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) has historically supplied fresh food to the urban population until half way through the 20th century. In 2018, the land use was still composed 38% of agricultural area, supplying 12% of the total food produced and consumed in Portugal. However, the operation of this food system is not subject to any regulations either in terms of spatial planning or land use management and, as such, its impact on sustainability transition in the region is not yet properly known. How to drive food transition in the LMA has thus arisen as a prominent question. In 2019, within a living lab context, the first steps were taken to this very challenging pathway, in which the definition of a food strategy was identified as the priority to sow the seeds of a food planning process. Over the last three years a food network started to operate on a collaborative basis to co-define a set of long-term objectives, a vision for 2030 and a collaborative biannual action plan. This article describes the process on how FoodLink—Network for the Food Transition in the LMA—leveraged the foundations to set up an evidence-based food strategy in the metropolitan area and how its thirty members became committed to cooperating in a science–policy–practice interface for its elaboration. According to principles of action–research and citizen science that implied a direct observation and involvement of the author along the entire process, the results intend to respond to the three objectives of the research by: (i) contributing to the literature on food networks; (ii) describing how the networking process occurred and its main achievements in what concerns a committed action plan; (iii) presenting the first baseline to pursue a food strategy towards the food planning of the city-region. It is understood that these results on how the food transition process is being driven in the LMA may either be inspiring for the construction of similar initiatives in other city regions, within and outside Europe, or may constitute the referential starting point for the future assessment of this ongoing transdisciplinary process.

T1  - To Be or Not to Be? Strategic Analysis of Carbon Tax Guiding Manufacturers to Choose Low-Carbon Technology
AN  - 2739479750
AB  - This paper analyzes the environmental tax’s effect on manufacturers’ choice of low-carbon technology in competitive supply chains. The existing studies only consider a single oligopoly enterprise and ignore the competition between supply chains. Few papers study the manufacturer’s technology choice under the carbon tax policy in the competitive supply chains, especially investigating the factors influencing the technology choice, including the market volume, and technology carbon emission reduction efficiency because different industry sectors have their distinctive carbon emissions reduction efficiencies and facing the different market volume. The study adopts a game theoretical approach, including the three-level supply chain consisting of the regulator, the manufacturers, and the retailers. A high carbon tax does not always help firms choose low-carbon technology. However, the monotonous effect of the carbon tax on manufacturer technology selection is no longer valid if the market volume and the carbon-reducing efficiency are considered. When the market volume is large, the regulator can set a high carbon tax to induce the manufacturers to choose low-carbon technology. We identify cases where the manufacturers are caught in a prisoner’s dilemma. When the market volume is small, and the carbon-reducing efficiency is high, the competitive manufacturers adopt the common technology. However, if the regulator increases the carbon tax, the manufacturers acquire the differential technology strategic choice, which is the Pareto optimal. We also extend the base model to the imperfect substitutable Cournot model and the Bertrand model to check the robustness and find our main results still hold in these extensions.

T1  - Taxonomy for Industrial Cluster Decarbonization: An Analysis for the Italian Hard-to-Abate Industry
AN  - 2739435995
AB  - The share of industry in final global energy consumption was more than 30% in 2020, of which, the hard-to-abate sectors accounted for almost 60% of total final consumption in industry. Similarly, in Europe, industry accounts for around 25% of final energy consumption. In order to reduce the impact of industry in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, Europe has set many policies that support and regulate the sector, including pricing carbon emissions in a cap-and-trade scheme called the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). According to the EU ETS, in 2021 the verified emissions of all stationary installations were around 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In 2021, the total allocated allowances amounted to around 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, half of which were freely allocated. After reviewing the existing modeling approaches for industrial clusters and the available datasets, and assessing the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions at plant level using a geographical information system approach (GIS), a taxonomy for industrial cluster decarbonization was introduced. This taxonomy shows that describing industry as sets of clustered installations rather than based on the conventional sectoral economic classification provides more insights into energy transition. First, the cluster description provides a more accurate techno-economic assessment based on a finer characterization of economies of scale compared to traditional energy systems models. Second, the industrial clustering approach may more realistically show the feasibility, in addition to the costs and benefits from coupling industry with transport (e.g., industrial fleets and logistics) or buildings (e.g., city scale), due to a more detailed representation of the energy sources and sinks.

T1  - A Comprehensive Study on the Expansion of Electric Vehicles in Europe
AN  - 2739421958
AB  - There has been a rapid increase in government efforts to expand electric vehicle markets by deploying fast-charging stations, promoting uptake through greater investment, and by enacting supportive policies. Government support and private investment have contributed to the expansion of electric vehicles in many countries. The aim of this study is to highlight and analyze the most critical aspects of the expansion of the electric vehicle market, regarding technologies, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, opportunities, and barriers in Europe. Our study analyzes the progress of electric vehicles by reviewing recent literature based on technology, policy, and government measurements. This study provides comprehensive information on electric vehicles and perspectives that are critical to policymakers, car manufacturers, consumers, and the community. To achieve favorable results, governments should invest in developing electric vehicles and battery technologies, provide subsidies, and develop charging infrastructure. Furthermore, by analyzing current EV sales in ten countries around the world, we assess the operating costs of electric vehicles. Overall EV cost of ownership is influenced by grid electricity price, cost of financing, location, carbon tax, wind speed, and solar insolation.

T1  - Developments in 3D Visualisation of the Rail Tunnel Subsurface for Inspection and Monitoring
AN  - 2739420998
AB  - Featured ApplicationThe review presented in this work has practical application to the conception, development and refinement of new technologies and visualisation frameworks pertaining to railway tunnel subsurface inspection. Subsequent application to the development of prototype self-sustaining digital twin tunnels also presents opportunity. In both cases, practical end user benefit would be improvement to the clarity and comprehensiveness of subsurface inspection datasets, better informing targeted maintenance strategy planning.AbstractRailway Tunnel SubSurface Inspection (RTSSI) is essential for targeted structural maintenance. ‘Effective’ detection, localisation and characterisation of fully concealed features (i.e., assets, defects) is the primary challenge faced by RTSSI engineers, particularly in historic masonry tunnels. Clear conveyance and communication of gathered information to end-users poses the less frequently considered secondary challenge. The purpose of this review is to establish the current state of the art in RTSSI data acquisition and information conveyance schemes, in turn formalising exactly what constitutes an ‘effective’ RTSSI visualisation framework. From this knowledge gaps, trends in leading RTSSI research and opportunities for future development are explored. Literary analysis of over 300 resources (identified using the 360-degree search method) informs data acquisition system operation principles, common strengths and limitations, alongside leading studies and commercial tools. Similar rigor is adopted to appraise leading information conveyance schemes. This provides a comprehensive whilst critical review of present research and future development opportunities within the field. This review highlights common shortcomings shared by multiple methods for RTSSI, which are used to formulate robust criteria for a contextually ‘effective’ visualisation framework. Although no current process is deemed fully effective; a feasible hybridised framework capable of meeting all stipulated criteria is proposed based on identified future research avenues. Scope for novel analysis of helical point cloud subsurface datasets obtained by a new rotating ground penetrating radar antenna is of notable interest.

T1  - Optimisation and Efficiency Improvement of Electric Vehicles Using Computational Fluid Dynamics Modelling
AN  - 2734621247
AB  - Due to the rise in awareness of global warming, many attempts to increase efficiency in the automotive industry are becoming prevalent. Design optimization can be used to increase the efficiency of electric vehicles by reducing aerodynamic drag and lift. The main focus of this paper is to analyse and optimise the aerodynamic characteristics of an electric vehicle to improve efficiency of using computational fluid dynamics modelling. Multiple part modifications were used to improve the drag and lift of the electric hatchback, testing various designs and dimensions. The numerical model of the study was validated using previous experimental results obtained from the literature. Simulation results are analysed in detail, including velocity magnitude, drag coefficient, drag force and lift coefficient. The modifications achieved in this research succeeded in reducing drag and were validated through some appropriate sources. The final model has been assembled with all modifications and is represented in this research. The results show that the base model attained an aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.464, while the final design achieved a reasonably better overall performance by recording a 10% reduction in the drag coefficient. Moreover, within individual comparison with the final model, the second model with front spitter had an insignificant improvement, limited to 1.17%, compared with 11.18% when the rear diffuser was involved separately. In addition, the lift coefficient was significantly reduced to 73%, providing better stabilities and accounting for the safety measurements, especially at high velocity. The prediction of the airflow improvement was visualised, including the pathline contours consistent with the solutions. These research results provide a considerable transformation in the transportation field and help reduce fuel expenses and global emissions.

T1  - A large-sample investigation into uncertain climate change impacts on high flows across Great Britain
AN  - 2732490335
AB  - Climate change may significantly increase flood risk globally, but there are large uncertainties in both future climatic changes and how these propagate into changing river flows. Here, the impact of climate change on the magnitude and frequency of high flows is analysed for Great Britain (GB) to provide the first spatially consistent GB projections to include both climate ensembles and hydrological model parameter uncertainties. We use the latest high-resolution (12 km) regional climate model ensemble from the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). These projections are based on a perturbed-physics ensemble of 12 regional climate model simulations and allow exploration of climate model uncertainty beyond the variability caused by the use of different models. We model 346 larger (>144 km2) catchments across GB using the DECIPHeR hydrological modelling framework. Generally, results indicated an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high flows (Q10, Q1, and annual maximum) along the western coast of GB in the future (2050–2075), with increases in annual maximum flows of up to 65 % for western Scotland. In contrast, median flows (Q50) were projected to decrease across GB. Even when using an ensemble based on a single regional climate model (RCM) structure, all flow projections contained large uncertainties. While the RCM parameters were the largest source of uncertainty overall, hydrological modelling uncertainties were considerable in eastern and south-eastern England. Regional variations in flow projections were found to relate to (i) differences in climatic change and (ii) catchment conditions during the baseline period as characterised by the runoff coefficient (mean discharge divided by mean precipitation). Importantly, increased heavy-precipitation events (defined by an increase in 99th percentile precipitation) did not always result in increased flood flows for catchments with low runoff coefficients, highlighting the varying factors leading to changes in high flows. These results provide a national overview of climate change impacts on high flows across GB, which will inform climate change adaptation, and highlight the impact of hydrological model parameter uncertainties when modelling climate change impact on high flows.

T1  - Sustainable Urban Regeneration Strategies in Korea’s Abandoned Mine Area Using Industrial Heritage
AN  - 2732355951
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish sustainable urban regeneration strategies for the abandoned mine area by applying the industrial heritage in Taebaek city. To this end, this study first analyzed the urban regeneration strategies for abandoned mine areas in Western societies like the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, the United States, and Spain. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with the concerned parties to analyze the abandoned mine areas in Taebaek city in line with the urban regeneration theoretical framework. The provision of urban regeneration strategies that apply the industrial heritage of the coal-mining areas involves the categories of urban regeneration like society, economy, environment, history, and cultural frameworks. The final findings deduced measures for two categories including the measures of activating Taebaek city as a cultural and also a leisure and sports city. The urban regeneration strategies to design Taebaek city as a cultural city include an EDM Festival by applying the dismal mood of the coal preparation plant industrial heritage in Taebaek city and Cheoram music and Lightning Road with industrial heritage. The urban regeneration strategies to design a leisure and sports city include a road bicycle racing contest by utilizing the geographical environment in Taebaek city which boasts high altitudes and Color Run. The two strategies of culture and leisure and sports contents deduced in the study can commonly utilize the industrial heritage of Taebaek city. Furthermore, as there is a continual demand for community participation, it is anticipated to apply it as the sustainable urban regeneration strategies of Taebaek city.

T1  - Relics of War: Damaged Structures and Their Replacement or Management in Modern Landscapes
AN  - 2728548899
AB  - All wars, large and small scale, have had impacts on the built environments enmeshed in the conflict. This is almost always an adverse reaction, often involving destruction, but can also include the construction of defensive or other features. Damaged sites can be redeveloped relatively quickly, though some can persist for decades and some evidence of damage may be deliberately retained for a range of reasons. Damaged structures may remain for decades or centuries, especially if built on a large scale, and, if surviving, may undergo re-evaluation and retention as heritage features. This paper explores the fate of a range of relict features from the Second World War, surviving into modern urban and rural landscapes through inaction or deliberate action. Using a wide range of examples particularly from the UK but also drawing on others from elsewhere in Europe, we explore the impact of conflict on such relics; their nature and scale, processes of decision-making affecting their treatment over the last seven decades, and their landscape impact. The physical legacy of this war still affects many communities. Changing values so long after the conflict, and the decay of unmaintained structures, gives an urgency to reviewing the future of surviving relics.

T1  - Evaluation of the Quality of the Housing Environment Using Multi-Criteria Analysis That Includes Energy Efficiency: A Review
AN  - 2728470951
AB  - The quality of the housing environment (HE) is an important issue that has a direct impact on the life of inhabitants. Aiming for quality in residential architecture begins with a well-designed HE, with the designing process being a value that is difficult to evaluate. Nowadays, a well-designed HE takes into account the energy efficiency of a building. An appropriate degree of thermal comfort, which is required by inhabitants, needs to be considered at the design stage. Designers can use building certification programs and multi-criteria analysis to motivate investors to construct buildings in accordance with energy efficiency requirements. These systems respond to the needs of energy efficiency, thermal comfort, sustainable heating, and ventilation. Defining ways and methods to evaluate quality in architectural projects will allow the value of the HE to be improved. For this purpose, a multi-criteria analysis of five systems that can be used to evaluate HE quality and energy efficiency in a temperate climate was conducted: (1) Building For Life 12, (2) Home Quality Mark, (3) Housing Quality Indicators, (4) Système D’évaluation De Logements (Sel), and (5) NF Habitat-NF Habitat HQE. This analysis concerned information about the systems, their applicability in practice, and the applied assessment measures. The article shows that the quality of the HE consists of specific factors that can be distinguished and indicated by evaluation systems. As a result of the carried out assessment of the housing environment, 13 original categories of building assessment criteria were defined. The results of the conducted analysis indicated that it is possible to: (i) identify factors for the improvement of HE quality; (ii) prepare objective systems for the measurement of the HE; and (iii) use such systems in practice, e.g., in the design industry, real estates, and public administration. Moreover, the systems can be used in legal regulations for updating urban policies.

T1  - Air Pollution Dispersion Modelling in Urban Environment Using CFD: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2728432044
AB  - Air pollution is a global problem, which needs to be understood and controlled to ensure a healthy environment and inform sustainable development. Urban areas have been established as one of the main contributors to air pollution, and, as such, urban air quality is the subject of an increasing volume of research. One of the principal means of studying air pollution dispersion is to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Subject to careful verification and validation, these models allow for analysts to predict air flow and pollution concentration for various urban morphologies under different environmental conditions. This article presents a detailed review of the use of CFD to model air pollution dispersion in an urban environment over the last decade. The review extracts and summarises information from nearly 90 pieces of published research, categorising it according to over 190 modelling features, which are thematically systemised into 7 groups. The findings from across the field are critically compared to available urban air pollution modelling guidelines and standards. Among the various quantitative trends and statistics from the review, two key findings stand out. The first is that, despite the existence of best practice guidelines for pollution dispersion modelling, anywhere between 12% and 34% of the papers do not specify one or more aspects of the utilised models, which are required to reproduce the study. The second is that none of the articles perform verification and validation according to accepted standards. The results of this review can, therefore, be used by practitioners in the field of pollution dispersion modelling to understand the general trends in current research and to identify open problems to be addressed in the future.

T1  - Climate Stories: enabling and sustaining arts interventions in climate science communication
AN  - 2725239565
AB  - The climate science community faces a major challenge with respect to communicating the risks associated with climate change within a heavily politicised landscape that is characterised by varying degrees of denial, scepticism, distrust in scientific enterprise, and an increased prevalence of misinformation (“fake news”). This issue is particularly significant given the reliance on conventional “deficit” communication approaches, which are based on the assumption that scientific information provision will necessarily lead to desired behavioural changes. Indeed, the constrained orthodoxy of scientific practices in seeking to maintain strict objectivity and political separation imposes very tangible limits on the potential effectiveness of climate scientists for communicating risk in many contemporary settings. To address these challenges, this paper uses insights from a collaboration between UK climate scientists and artist researchers to argue for a more creative and emotionally attentive approach to climate science engagement and advocacy. In so doing, the paper highlights innovative ways in which climate change communication can be reimagined through different art forms to enable complex concepts to become knowable. We suggest that in learning to express their work through forms of art, including print-making, theatre and performance, song-writing, and creative writing, researchers experienced not only a sense of liberation from the rigid communicative framework operating in their familiar scientific environment but also a growing self-confidence in their ability and willingness to engage in new ways of expressing their work. As such, we argue that scientific institutions and funding bodies should recognise the potential value of climate scientists engaging in advocacy through art–science collaborations and that these personal investments and contributions to science engagement by individuals should be rewarded and valued alongside conventional scientific outputs.

T1  - The Impact of Time Spent in Natural Outdoor Spaces on Children’s Language, Communication and Social Skills: A Systematic Review Protocol
AN  - 2724258537
AB  - There has been increasing interest over the past decade with regard to the health and wellbeing implications of time spent outdoors in nature for children. Universal systematic reviews of evidence report benefits to physical health, social-emotional mental health and wellbeing, cognition and academic learning. Internationally, there is indicative evidence to suggest outdoor engagement with nature may also impact children’s language and communication skills, skills that are critical to development, education, social relationships and life opportunities. Yet, at present such evidence has not been synthesised. Despite evidence for the benefits of the outdoors, the amount of time children are spending outdoors is in rapid decline, and has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside this are increasing numbers of children starting primary education with significant speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) which remain persistent over time. With established wide-reaching benefits of nature to children’s physical and mental health and psychological development, there is a need to further explore the more specific impacts of the natural environment on children’s language, communication and social skills, which could provide a unique opportunity to consider nature as a universal public health intervention for SLCN. The current review will aim to synthesise existing qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of time spent in natural outdoor spaces on the language, communication and social skills of 2–11-year-old children. Literature will be searched across seven databases and considered for inclusion against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential implications of the review include informing public health practice and policy for child development and education, informing priorities for speech, language, and communication interventions, and providing directions for future international research.

T1  - Planning, Operation, and Design of Market-Based Virtual Power Plant Considering Uncertainty
AN  - 2724242945
AB  - The power systems of today seem inseparable from clean energy sources such as wind turbines (WTs) and photovoltaics (PVs). However, due to their uncertain nature, operational challenges are expected when WT and PV energy is added to the electricity network. It is necessary to introduce new technologies to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs). Therefore, rationally implementing a demand response (DR) program with energy storage systems (ESSs) in a virtual power plant (VPP) environment is recommended as a way forward to minimize the volatile nature of RESs and improve power system reliability. Our proposed approach aims to maximize social welfare (SW) (i.e., maximization of consumer benefits while minimizing energy costs). Our method assesses the impact of the DR program on SW maximization. Two scenarios are examined, one with and one without a DR program. Stochastic programming theory is used to address the optimization problem. The uncertain behavior of WTs, PVs, and load demand is modeled using a scenario-based approach. The correctness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a 16-bus UK generic distribution system. Our results show that SW and active power dispatch capacity of WT, PV, and ESS are fairly increased using the proposed approach.

T1  - Modelling Case Study of Compact Combination Hybrids as Low Disruption Decarbonised Heat
AN  - 2724242860
AB  - Transitioning from predominantly natural gas domestic heating to low carbon heating is one of the major challenges of the UK’s net zero decarbonisation pathway. Compact wall-hung combination boilers are the dominant heating appliance and continue to be installed as a rate of over 1.5 million per year, compared to less than 50 k per year for Heat Pumps. The disparity persists despite repeated Government support in the form of the Renewable Heat Incentive and the Green Homes Grant. Compact hybrid appliances offer a technology solution similar to the current combination boiler in terms of size and performance, which could be attractive to consumers. However, there is currently little knowledge of the emissions savings that could be achieved in practice by compact hybrid appliances. This research systematically analyses real world high frequency boiler data to evaluate the potential of such appliances to make carbon savings while emulating combination boiler operation. By utilising high frequency diagnostic data from combination boilers, the disaggregated (hot water and heating) demand is mapped onto hybrid models to determine the energy and emission impact. Exploration of the relative power output of the HP and boiler components of the modelled hybrid appliances provides insight into the appropriate specification of compact hybrids which can deliver similar heat service to boilers while maximising emissions savings. The analysis shows that hybrid appliances with moderately sized HPs can significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of the homes considered in the study. Considerable disruption could be avoided in retrofit due to the physical size of the proposed heat pump and ability of the hybrid system to operate with the existing heat emitter network.

T1  - From Active Houses to Active Homes: Understanding Resident Experiences of Transformational Design and Social Innovation
AN  - 2724242439
AB  - Active Buildings can contribute to efforts to address decarbonisation and climate change targets, and have the potential to support social aspirations for technical and infrastructural change. Yet achieving such goals is challenging. Active Homes as a type of Active Building represent a particularly interesting prospect; altering how energy is produced, distributed, and consumed, but also how homes are designed, constructed, and lived in are studied. Active Homes are designed with expectations of how residents will engage with them, but residents do not always live in the homes in ways envisaged by developers. Hence, there is a risk that the homes will not be experienced as comfortable living environments, or otherwise perform as anticipated. Thus, understanding resident perspectives is crucial to the successful wider rollout of Active Homes. We draw on social science research with designers, developers, and residents to explore expectations of life in an Active Home. Our longitudinal research design enables us to contrast early expectations with post-occupancy experiences, elucidating what residents consider to be successful aspects of Active Home developments. Our research reveals instances where expectations remain unfulfilled, or where living in the homes has been experienced as challenging or disruptive. In highlighting such insights, we offer recommendations relevant for future developments.

T1  - Eliciting Stakeholders’ Requirements for Future Energy Systems: A Case Study of Heat Decarbonisation in the UK
AN  - 2724237734
AB  - It is a truism that whole energy system models underpin the development of policies for energy system decarbonisation. However, recent reviews have thrown doubt on the appropriateness of such models for addressing the multiple goals for future energy systems, in the face of emergent real-world complexity and the evolution of stakeholder’s priorities. Without an understanding of the changing priorities of policy makers and expectations of stakeholders for future systems, system objectives and constraints are likely to be ill-defined, and there is a risk that models may be inadvertently instrumentalised. Adopting a system architecture perspective, the authors have undertaken a three-year programme of research to explore strategies for decarbonising heat in the UK, with interaction with and elicitation of needs from stakeholders at its heart. This paper presents the procedure, methods, and results of an exercise in which experts from stakeholder organisations across the energy system were interviewed. Analysis of interview data reveals two broad approaches to heat decarbonisation which can be defined as either adaptive or transformative. Specific insights gained from these interviews enabled our modelling teams to refocus their work for exploration with a wider circle of stakeholders. Results suggests that this iterative approach to formalising model-policy interaction could improve the transparency and legitimacy of modelling and enhance its impact on policy making.

T1  - Mid-Late Quaternary Fluvial Archives near the Margin of the MIS 12 Glaciation in Southern East Anglia, UK: Amalgamation of Multi-Disciplinary and Citizen-Science Data Sources
AN  - 2716604917
AB  - This paper presents an updated geological reconstruction of the Quaternary evolution of the River Thames at its downstream extremities, close to the North Sea coast, based on new data from multi-disciplinary and citizen-science sources. In this area, the interaction of the Thames with the MIS 12 (Anglian) glaciation is an important part of the Quaternary archive. The Anglian ice sheet, which reached parts of north and east London, was responsible for diverting the Thames southwards into its present course, although the footprint of the maximum ice sheet(s) does not reach the North Sea coast south of Hollesley, Suffolk. Further south, the coastal zone hosts pre-Anglian and early Anglian river-terrace deposits of the pre-diversion Thames system, superimposed upon which are products of later post-Anglian rivers, of both Middle and Late Pleistocene age. On the peninsula between the Stour and Blackwater–Colne estuaries, the lowest and most recent terrace of the pre-diversion Thames includes evidence directly pertaining to the glacial disruption event, for which geochronological data are reported here for the first time. The first post-diversion terrace of the Thames also reaches this peninsula, the river having essentially re-joined its original valley before crossing the alignment of the modern coastline. This terrace passes beneath Clacton-on-Sea, where it includes the type locality of the Clactonian Palaeolithic Industry. The area of interest to this paper, in NE Essex and southern Suffolk, includes a number of interglacial and Palaeolithic sites, the data from which assist in constraining the chronostratigraphy of the sequence. In some cases, there has been uncertainty as to whether these sites represent pre-Anglian environments and hominin occupations, part of the palaeo-Thames sequence, or whether they are the product of later post-Anglian streams, formed after the Thames had migrated southwards. This paper compiles evidence from a wide range of recent sources, including developer-funded archaeological appraisal and citizen-science activities, to explore and update the evidence from sites at Ipswich, Upper Dovercourt and Thorpe-le-Soken, as well as a number of localities associated with the Clacton Channel Deposits (host to the type-Clactonian), amongst others. The resulting new data are placed within the wider context of the Quaternary fluvial archives in southern Britain, with a discussion of how disparate sources of information, including the work of citizen scientists, have contributed.

T1  - How to Argue with Questions and Answers: Argumentation Strategies in Parliamentary Deliberation
AN  - 2716557746
AB  - While apparently designed to request information, parliamentary questions are the most challenging and face-threatening acts, used argumentatively by opposition members of parliament (MPs) to confront and attack government MPs, and especially the Prime Minister (PM) in the notoriously adversarial Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs). By contextually, discursively and rhetorically articulating varying degrees of relevance and persuasiveness, questioning and answering practices serve as basic debating tools for MPs, whose main parliamentary role and responsibility consist of holding the government and the PM accountable. The aim of this paper is to explore how argumentation/counter-argumentation strategies and persuasive/dissuasive techniques are shaped through the co-performance of MPs’ questioning and the PM’s answering practices in PMQs. To better capture the effects of the shifting dynamics of polemical question-answer exchanges between political adversaries, the present analysis is based on the cross-fertilization of pragma-rhetoric and argumentation theory. The commonalities and complementarities of these approaches have been used to identify and problematize the higher or lower degrees of argumentation at the question-answer interface in terms of valid or fallacious reasoning patterns in three categories of strategic questions: yes/no questions, wh-questions and disjunctive questions.

T1  - Energy Poverty and Personal Health in the EU
AN  - 2716548057
AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of energy poverty on health in the EU-27 countries for the period from 2003–2020 using Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag models and generalized ridge regressions. Arrears on utility bills exerts positive long-run effects on capacity to keep the home adequately warm, current health expenditures, and self-perceived health as bad or very bad, but a negative long-run influence on energy import dependency. In the long-term, the population being unable to keep their home adequately warm positively affects self-perceived health as bad and very bad and negatively influences number of cooling days. Current health expenditure has a long-run influence on self-perceived health as bad and very bad and the number of heating days. Positive short-run impacts were observed for energy import dependency, arrears on utility bills, and number of heating days on current health expenditure and the population unable to keep their home adequately warm. People at risk of poverty or social exclusion in different zones had a significant impact on energy poverty indicators. A separate analysis is made for those EU states with the highest energy import dependency and the implications of the results are discussed.

T1  - Reducing Carbon Footprint of Agriculture—Can Organic Farming Help to Mitigate Climate Change?
AN  - 2716477098
AB  - In the face of a changing climate, intensive efforts are needed for limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C. Agricultural production has the potential to play an important role in mitigating climate change. It is necessary to optimize all of the agricultural practices that have high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Among the plant production processes, mineral fertilization is of the greatest importance in the formation of the carbon footprint (CF) of crops. There are many possibilities for reducing GHG emissions from the application of fertilizers. Further benefits in reducing the CF can be obtained through combining tillage treatments, reduced and no-till technologies, and the cultivation of catch crops and leguminous plants. Organic farming has the potential for reducing GHG emissions and improving organic carbon sequestration. This system eliminates synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and thus could lower global agricultural GHG emissions. Organic farming could result in a higher soil organic carbon content compared to non-organic systems. When used together with other environmentally friendly farming practices, significant reductions of GHG emissions can be achieved.

T1  - Effectiveness of an online module: climate-change and sustainability in clinical practice
AN  - 2715464985
AB  - Background 
Climate change has significant implications for health, yet healthcare provision itself contributes significant greenhouse gas emission. Medical students need to be prepared to address impacts of the changing environment and fulfil a key role in climate mitigation. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of an online module on climate-change and sustainability in clinical practice designed to achieve learning objectives adapted from previously established sustainable healthcare priority learning outcomes.
 Methods 
A multi-media, online module was developed, and 3rd and 4th year medical students at Brighton and Sussex Medical School were invited to enrol. Students completed pre- and post-module questionnaires consisting of Likert scale and white space answer questions. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of responses was performed.
 Results 
Forty students enrolled and 33 students completed the module (83% completion rate). There was a significant increase in reported understanding of key concepts related to climate change and sustainability in clinical practice (p < 0.001), with proportion of students indicating good or excellent understanding increasing from between 2 – 21% students to between 91 – 97% students. The majority (97%) of students completed the module within 90 min. All students reported the module was relevant to their training. Thematic analysis of white space responses found students commonly reported they wanted access to more resources related to health and healthcare sustainability, as well as further guidance on how to make practical steps towards reducing the environmental impact within a clinical setting.
 Conclusion 
This is the first study to evaluate learner outcomes of an online module in the field of sustainable health and healthcare. Our results suggest that completion of the module was associated with significant improvement in self-assessed knowledge of key concepts in climate health and sustainability. We hope this approach is followed elsewhere to prepare healthcare staff for impacts of climate change and to support improving the environmental sustainability of healthcare delivery.

T1  - The PlaceMarker Survey: A Place-Based Tool for Supporting the Monitoring and Appraisal of River-Related Projects and Natural Capital Assessments
AN  - 2706439598
AB  - The PlaceMarker Survey is an operational tool to support the delivery of the core aims of England’s Environment Agency (EA) in helping to increase resilience to climate change, manage flood risk, and create a better place for people and wildlife. It was developed in response to a recognised need by the EA’s National Environmental Assessment and Sustainability (NEAS) team for a broad-based survey undertaken in the field to get to know the site and prior to more specialist surveys. The key aim of the survey is to capture in a systematic and consistent way the character and condition of a place where river-related projects such as flood risk management and river restoration schemes are proposed to inform discussions around the design and planning of a project and provide the baseline for future place-based monitoring. The tool comprises: a Study Area Survey and one or more River Surveys, which provide measurements to generate metrics and information to support assessments of Habitat and Biodiversity, Landscape, Amenity, and Heritage. Data are stored, analysed, retrieved, shared, and displayed through a web-based information system. It is intended that a PlaceMarker Survey will be conducted on at least three occasions in the lifetime of a project or asset: pre-inception of a project to understand the broad environmental baseline and assist in the design of a scheme; immediately post-project to confirm the “as-built condition”; and post-recovery from the works to monitor the environmental response to interventions at the site. Tracking the assessments over time informs evaluations of environmental enhancements and supports decision-making around adaptive management.

T1  - Strategic Capabilities for Enhancing the Flood Resilience of Business Premises: An Expert Review and Lessons from Case Studies
AN  - 2706435642
AB  - Sustainable development entails socio-economic wellbeing, which is often threatened by weather hazards. Indeed, the need to minimise the adverse impact of climate change and extreme weather events cannot be overstressed. Notably, damage to the built environment by extreme weather and its consequential effects is highly significant. This emphasises the need for a climate-resilient built environment. Thus, this study derived the strategic capability areas required by business organisations to achieve the flood resilience of their built environment. The research method involved rounds of review by a carefully selected team of experts, and the review of lessons from four case studies. Twenty-six capability areas were identified from literature but were consolidated to nineteen at the end of data collection and analysis. The capability areas covered how properties are used and managed as well as the actual fabric and design of business premises/properties. The capability areas included awareness and understanding of flood risk to property, review for a flood resilience scheme, product acquisition for flood risk management, dynamic stakeholder identification and strong network, maintenance and post-flood management scheme, physical characteristics of the property and business data management. Professionals and business organisations can use the outcome of this study as a guide for business premises flood resilience enhancement planning and decision making.

T1  - Methylmercury Risk Assessment Based on European Human Biomonitoring Data
AN  - 2706431983
AB  - A risk assessment (RA) was conducted to estimate the risk associated with methylmercury (MeHg) exposure of vulnerable European populations, using Human Biomonitoring (HBM) data. This RA was performed integrating published data from European HBM surveys and earlier EFSA approaches (EFSA 2012). Children/adolescents (3 to 17 years old) and women of childbearing age (18 to 50 years old) were selected as relevant study population groups for this RA. Two types of HBM datasets were selected: HBM studies (n = 18) with mercury (Hg) levels (blood and hair, total Hg and/or MeHg) in the general population in different EU countries and the DEMOCOPHES harmonized study in child–mother pairs (hair, total Hg) in 17 EU countries as a reference. Two approaches were included in the RA strategy: the first one was based on estimations of the fraction of children/adolescents and women of childbearing age, respectively, from the EU general population exceeding the HBM-I value established by the German Human Biomonitoring Commission, measured as Hazard Quotients (HQ); and the second approach was based on estimations of the fraction of the two population groups exceeding the Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI) (or their equivalent to Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI)) defined by EFSA in 2012. The HQ approach showed that for both groups, the risk varies across EU countries and that some EU areas are close to or exceeding the exposure guidance values. This is the case of Spain and Portugal, which showed the highest HQ (GM and/or P95), probably due to their higher fish consumption. Results from the EFSA approach show that hair values of children/adolescents and women of childbearing age (both in selected HBM studies and in DEMOCOPHES study) are below the TDI of 1.9 µg/g; therefore, in general, the European population does not exceed the daily average/intake dose for MeHg and/or Hg. A possible risk underestimation was identified in our assessment since for many studies no data on P95 were available, causing loss of relevant information for risk characterization on the upper bound. In addition, data from other European countries also with high seafood consumption, such as France, Greece or Iceland, were not available. For this reason, further RA refinement is needed with harmonized and more widespread HBM data to account for differences in European exposure and associated risks, so that interventions to protect vulnerable citizens, can be applied.

T1  - Retrofitting Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS): A Cost-Benefit Analysis Appraisal
AN  - 2706430265
AB  - Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) are known to help mitigate flooding whilst simultaneously delivering other positive outcomes, such as the provision of environmental, economic, educational, and business benefits. Despite this, there has been a relatively low uptake of SuDS in new developments and even less of an uptake in the opportunities for retrofitting SuDS in existing buildings. A major barrier to uptake has been a lack of understanding regarding the value of the benefits provided by SuDS. This study presents an appraisal of the costs and benefits derived from the retrofitting of SuDS in existing buildings and reveals some of the key decision-making considerations during the design and installation of such schemes. A qualitative research approach that included a number of case studies of successfully retrofitted SuDS schemes within public buildings was conducted. A novel feature of the research was the use of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) approach to value the tangible and intangible benefits provided by the various schemes from the perspectives of the property owners. The findings revealed that the retrofit provided a net value to the client of over £100,000 over 10 years, a mean CBA ratio of 5.3/10, and a return on investment (ROI) that would be achieved in less than 3 years. The importance of stakeholder engagement during the decision-making process was highlighted in helping to overcome many of the design, installation, and maintenance challenges. The findings demonstrate a significant ROI for these SuDs retrofit schemes and highlight useful approaches to overcoming the barriers in valuing the importance of the intangible benefits. In supporting the uptake of the retrofitting of SuDS, it is recommended that these benefits are given full consideration by property owners, urban planners, and architects during the design of retrofit schemes and throughout the decision-making stage.

T1  - Long-Term Strategies for the Compatibility of the Aviation Industry with Climate Targets: An Industrial Survey and Agenda for Systems Thinkers
AN  - 2706423816
AB  - Aviation is responsible for nearly 2.5% of the world’s anthropogenic carbon emissions. Despite a commitment to reduce these emissions, it is a challenging industry to decarbonise. Very little is known about the attitudes of those working in aviation towards climate change and whether they are motivated to support decarbonisation initiatives. This uncertainty highlights several threats to the industry, with cascading impact on the economy and inequality. To deal with these challenges, this study explores long-term strategies to support compatibility between the evolution of the aviation industry and climate constraints. Using surveys, in-depth interviews, and thematic analysis, this research investigates the views of professionals towards climate change, and the role that they perceive aviation plays. The results of the interviews allow the development of a system map composed of ten self-reinforcing and three balancing loops, highlighting ten leverage points to inform strategies for the industry to respond to threats. This research concludes that the aviation industry should encourage a new generation of sustainability-aware innovators to decarbonise aviation. It also concludes that collaboration both internationally and within the industry is essential, as is the need to encourage an open-minded approach to solution development. It also presents the modelling results in terms of the multilevel perspective technological transition framework and suggests ways forward for modelling using the risk–opportunity analysis.

T1  - Small-Scale Combined Heat and Power Systems: The Prospects for a Distributed Micro-Generator in the ‘Net-Zero’ Transition within the UK
AN  - 2706192290
AB  - Small-scale combined heat and power (micro-CHP or mCHP) plants generate heat in the process of localised electricity production that can usefully be captured and employed for domestic space and water heating. Studies of the relative merits of three alternative network-connected mCHP plants are reviewed based respectively on an Internal Combustion engine (ICE), a Stirling engine (SE), and a Fuel Cell (FC). Each plant will, in most cases, result in lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, relative to those from the most efficient condensing boilers. In addition, they lead to operational cost savings for the consumer, depending on house type. However, their capital costs are presently more expensive than a conventional boiler, with the FC being prohibitively so. The ICE and SE variants display the greatest economic and environmental benefit. Nevertheless, the performance and costs associated with these innovative technologies have rapidly improved over the last decade or so. Comparisons are also made with heat pumps that are seen as a major low-carbon competitor by the United Kingdom (UK) Government. Finally, the potential role of micro-CHP as part of a cluster of different micro-generators attached to contrasting dwellings is considered. The review places mCHP systems in the context of the UK transition pathway to net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, whilst meeting residential energy demand. However, the lessons learned are applicable to many industrialised countries.

T1  - Implementation of Climate Change Effects on Slope Stability Analysis
AN  - 2706109501
AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the impacts of expected climate change on slope stability. For this purpose, the case study of a slope instability, that was triggered in 2021 was selected. The stability analysis was performed considering the theory of rainfall infiltration and using Geo-Studio’s SEEP/W module for the surface infiltration model of the slope. A parametric stability analysis of the slope was conducted to determine the importance of climate change on slope stability. Conditions for changes in volumetric water content, water permeability, porewater pressure, and groundwater flow are important. When soil permeability is low, the factor of safety decreases during rainfall events and on the days following, while when permeability is higher, safety increases after rainfall events. The effect of lower cohesion is nearly linear, with the factor of safety decreasing by 0.1 for every 1 kPa less cohesion. The increase in net infiltration of water may be the most critical factor for slope instability. The results of the analysis indicate that timely reduction of water net infiltration through planting and proper surface water runoff from the upper road and slope would be a relatively simple and inexpensive measure compared to the cost of remediating the landslide, considering expected climate change. Therefore, it is advisable to analyze all slopes with respect to the expected climate change, taking into account the potential impacts of climate change.

T1  - Personal Carbon Budgets: A Pestle Review
AN  - 2700794686
AB  - Personal Carbon Budgets (PCBs) are a radical policy innovation that seek to reduce an individual’s carbon consumption. This review identifies three archetypes of PCBs in the current literature; Personal Carbon Trading, Carbon Tax and Carbon Labelling. We theorised that carbon trading could affect equity and allow quality of life and consumption to be driven by income rather than needs. We, therefore, developed a new model (Personal Carbon Allowance with no trading) to compare to existing archetypes. A PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) framework was applied to each archetype to analyse and compare their costs and benefits and to critically evaluate and identify which model may be the most appropriate to reduce emissions severely but equitably. We conclude that the only model that can achieve this is our proposed Personal Carbon Allowance (PCA) model with no trading. PCA has a hard cap on emissions allowing for controllable severe cuts to emissions, and the lack of trading would prohibit those with wealth from continuing high-consumption lifestyles at the expense of those with lower incomes.

T1  - Strategic Design and Delivery of Integrated Catchment Restoration Monitoring: Emerging Lessons from a 12-Year Study in the UK
AN  - 2700786169
AB  - Despite growing interest in river and catchment restoration, including a focus on nature-based solutions, assessing effectiveness of restoration programmes continues to prove a challenge. The development of the Eddleston Water project, the Scottish Government’s empirical study of the impact of implementing natural flood management measures on flood risk and habitat restoration, provides the opportunity to review restoration monitoring at a strategic and operational level for this long-running catchment restoration programme. The project has implemented an extensive range of restoration measures along the river and across the 69 km2 catchment. This paper reviews the monitoring strategy and assesses both how the monitoring network developed meets its strategic aims and what subsequent changes were made in monitoring design and implementation. Covering hydrology, hydromorphology and ecology, we explore how all three are integrated to provide a comprehensive assessment of restoration success. Lessons to help inform other river rehabilitation monitoring programmes include the importance of a scoping study and capturing the full range of environmental variables pre-restoration; the limitations of BACI designs; and the need to focus integrated monitoring on a process-based framework and impact cascade, whilst also covering the full trajectory of recovery.

T1  - Towards Active Buildings: Stakeholder Perceptions of the Next Generation of Buildings
AN  - 2700607578
AB  - Several regulations and standards have been developed to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, but these have failed to provide a clear pathway to a net zero future. Hence, we recently introduced the Active Building Code (ABCode). This provides guidance on reducing the environmental impact of the next generation of buildings, termed Active Buildings (ABs), through their synergy with the grid. This paper aims to illuminate the regulatory landscape, justify our initial proposal for the ABCode, and reveal opportunities and challenges to the popularisation of ABs. Twelve online focus group discussions were conducted, with thirty stakeholders in total, all selected on the basis of their expertise. A grounded theory approach identified five core themes in such discussions. These strongly overlap with what is incorporated in the ABCode, suggesting the code successfully captures issues important to experts. Stakeholders defined ABs as responsive buildings and proposed both energy and carbon are considered in their assessment. They hence aligned with the definition and evaluation framework proposed by the ABCode. Finally, stakeholders considered people’s tendency to prioritise capital cost as the greatest challenge to the popularisation of ABs, and the increasing demand for healthy environments as its greatest opportunity.

T1  - Current CO2 Capture and Storage Trends in Europe in a View of Social Knowledge and Acceptance. A Short Review
AN  - 2700591362
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) has reached a higher level of emissions in the last decades, and as it is widely known, CO2 is responsible for numerous environmental problems, such as climate change. Thus, there is a great need for the application of CO2 capture and storage, as well as of CO2 utilization technologies (CCUS). This review article focuses on summarizing the current CCUS state-of-the-art methods used in Europe. Special emphasis has been given to mineralization methods/technologies, especially in basalts and sandstones, which are considered to be suitable for CO2 mineralization. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey was also carried out in order to investigate how informed about CO2 issues European citizens are, as well as whether their background is relative to their positive or negative opinion about the establishment of CCUS technologies in their countries. In addition, social acceptance by the community requires contact with citizens and stakeholders, as well as ensuring mutual trust through open communication and the opportunity to participate as early as possible in the development of actions and projects related to CO2 capture and storage, at all appropriate levels of government internationally, as citizens need to understand the benefits from such new technologies, from the local to the international level.

T1  - In Search of Complementarity: Insights from an Exercise in Quantifying Qualitative Energy Futures
AN  - 2700591319
AB  - In this study, we considered a bridging strategy between qualitative and quantitative research with the aim of achieving complementarity. A pilot case study using the Sheffield Elicitation Framework “SHELF” to estimate appropriate inputs for a quantitative energy systems model (based on a qualitative energy future scenario) was used to gain insights. Of novelty are the ethnographic insights of an example translation procedure as well as the methodological approach of the translation procedure itself. This paper reports the findings from this exercise concerning the practicalities of applying such a technique and the observations from the expert elicitation process itself. Based on this pilot, we make two recommendations. The first is the importance of devising a strategy in projects, and research programmes, where bridging between qualitative and quantitative research activities would be most effective. The second is that observations of discussions during the expert elicitation process provide value in the provenance of the estimates for quantitative modelling purposes and provide considerations for further development of qualitative future scenarios.

T1  - Influence of Weather-Driven Processes on the Performance of UK Transport Infrastructure with Reference to Historic Geostructures
AN  - 2700547350
AB  - Several factors control the vulnerability of historic geostructures to climate change. These factors are both temporally and spatially variable depending on construction techniques and climatic conditions. This paper provides a review of both the historical construction practices on the UK transport network and recent developments in the understanding of climate change effects, allowing for an assessment of the impact of climate change on existing geostructures. Geostructures in the UK can be split between pre-regulation and post-regulation construction techniques. In general, highways were constructed after the implementation of modern regulations and are therefore less vulnerable to climate change due to formalisation of construction methods. In comparison, the performance of the railway network has shown to be inferior due to historic construction practices including poor or absent compaction, lack of consideration for foundations, or selection of fill materials. Recent findings have shown that the impacts of climate change are also a multiscale problem, influenced not only by regional geology but also the pore structure of soils and its evolution. While the research into these impacts is critical, the limitations of common methods employed to survey these structures and study the behaviour of their constituent materials requires consideration. In this paper, these aspects are examined in detail in a bid to integrate holistically the complexity of the systems involved.

T1  - Combining Tradable Credit Schemes with a New Form of Road Pricing: Producing Liveable Cities and Meeting Decarbonisation Goals
AN  - 2694085747
AB  - This paper considers how the implementation of a tradable credit scheme (TCS) may be used to reduce road traffic and to contribute to the formation of liveable cities and global climate change commitments. The concept of applying TCS to individual road transport is familiar to transport researchers as a measure to regulate congestion and reduce transport-related emissions. Yet, it is not a strategy currently being considered by policy makers in the UK, despite the electrification of the road vehicle fleet and the associated loss of tax revenue presenting a rare opportunity to alter the economic instruments, which apply to road traffic. We consider how transport researchers can capitalise on this unique moment in transport history to shape transport policy. Our study uses qualitative methods, including a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with transport stakeholders and experts, in addition to a literature review and document analysis. Data analysis is inductive, permitting the formation of new ideas about the potential benefits of TCS and the barriers to the application of TCS to real-world policy. Building upon the results of TCS experiments and the results of our analysis, we propose a novel potential form of TCS combined with road pricing to maintain government revenue, which incentivises road users to decrease road vehicle kilometres travelled and reduce pollution and congestion. The proposal contributes to the discussion on the governance of road transport and taxation.

T1  - EVB-Supportive Energy Management for Residential Systems with Renewable Energy Supply
AN  - 2694080123
AB  - This study examines the potential role that an Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB) can play in Home Energy Management System (HEMS) based on a future development on the performance and costs of batteries. The value of EVB in an HEMS with different home connection settings and energy consumption/storage/generation capacities are investigated to advise the optimal future HEMS setups. Solar PV are considered as the residential renewal energy supply, which is the main resource of uncertainty of the system. A novel forecasting model is deployed which incorporates geographical information, solar radiation forecast and weather-related conditions into an exponential-based method to simulate day-ahead solar PV output. Optimal flows of energy and usage of storage (batteries) are then captured by a Stochastic Programming (SP) model and solved by CPLEX. Managerial insights and optimal designs of the HEMS are drawn based on the results obtained.

T1  - Recipes for Resilience: Engaging Caribbean Youth in Climate Action and Food Heritage through Stories and Song
AN  - 2694069241
AB  - This paper presents findings from the Recipes for Resilience project, an international, interdisciplinary collaboration between Caribbean and UK scholars of history, geography, anthropology, cultural studies, development studies, ethnobotany, and climate-risk studies, and the research partners, the Caribbean Youth Environment Network. The purpose of the project was to investigate how agrifood heritage may be mobilized in creative ways to engage Caribbean youth in climate action and justice. The project utilized arts and humanities methods, such as storytelling, songwriting, online games, and brief research-led talks, culminating in the co-created song: “Food and Resistance for Climate Resilience”. The results of the project provide evidence that climate action requires arts and humanities methods to appeal to youth, as opposed to purely fact-based or scientific forms of climate communication. We conclude that co-creative methods such as music and storytelling can inspire youth to engage in climate action, in this case through a (re)valuation culinary and agricultural heritage.

T1  - Existing evidence on the impacts of within-field farmland management practices on the flux of greenhouse gases from arable cropland in temperate regions: a systematic map
AN  - 2691509711
AB  - Background 
Reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is vital for mitigating climate change and meeting commitments to international agreements such as the COP 21 Paris Agreement of 2015. Agriculture is reported to account for approximately 11 percent of total global GHG emissions such that: the agricultural sector has an important role to play in meeting climate change mitigation objectives. However, there is currently little consensus on how farm management and interventions, along with interactions with in-field variability, such as soil type, affect the production and assimilation of GHGs in arable crop lands. Practical recommendations for farmers are often vague or generalised, and models (e.g. on the amount of nitrogen fertiliser applied) are used despite limited understanding of the influence of local conditions, such as the importance of soil type. Here, we report the findings of a systematic map of the evidence relating to the impact on GHG flux from the in-field management of arable land in temperate regions.
 Methods 
We searched for, collated and catalogued research relating to the effects of in-field arable farming practices in temperate systems on GHG emissions. Results from 6 bibliographic databases, a web-based search engine and organisational websites were combined with evidence from stakeholders. Duplicates were removed and the results were then screened for relevance at title and abstract, and full-text levels according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria (following consistency checking). Relevant studies were then coded and their meta-data extracted and used to populate a systematic map database describing each study’s settings, methods and measured outcomes.
 Results 
The mapping process identified 538 relevant studies from 351 articles. Nearly all of these (96%) were found from traditional research papers, with 42% from European countries and nearly half (203 studies) lasting for 12 months or less. Over half of all studies (55%) investigated multiple interventions with chemical fertiliser (n = 100), tillage (n = 70), and organic fertiliser (n = 30) the most frequently studied single intervention types. When combining individually studied and multiple interventions, the top three intervention types most frequently studied were: chemical fertiliser (n = 312); organic fertiliser (n = 176) and tillage (n = 158). Nitrous oxide was the most commonly studied outcome, with over double the number of studies compared to carbon dioxide, the next most studied outcome. Sandy loam and silty loam were the most commonly studied soils but there was a good distribution of studies across other types. However, studies predominately focused on humid sub-tropical (Cfa) and temperate oceanic (Cfb) climates, with hot summer Mediterranean (CSa) and warm summer Mediterranean (Csb) climate zones less represented.
 Conclusions 
The mapping process identified clusters of research for chemical and organic fertiliser especially in relation to nitrous oxide emissions and for both carbon dioxide and nitrous dioxide in relation to tillage. Therefore, there is potential for further synthesis for these interventions. The spread of research across soil textures and in the humid sub-tropical and temperate oceanic climates may enable further synthesis to provide tailored in-field advice for farmers and provide an evidence base to inform subsidies policy. However, smaller amounts of research relating to biochar, cover crops, crop rotation, and nitrogen inhibitors highlight gaps where further research would be beneficial.

T1  - The Landscape and Roadmap of the Research and Innovation Infrastructures in Energy: A Review of the Case Study of the UK
AN  - 2679835654
AB  - Research and development are critical for driving economic growth. To realise the UK government’s Industrial Strategy, we develop an energy research and innovation infrastructure roadmap and landscape for the energy sector looking to the long term (2030). This study is based on a picture of existing UK infrastructure on energy. It shows the links between the energy sector and other sectors, the distribution of energy research and innovation infrastructures, the age of these infrastructures, where most of the energy research and innovation infrastructures are hosted, and the distribution of energy research and innovation infrastructures according to their legal structure. Next, this study identifies the roadmap of energy research and innovation infrastructures by 2030, based on a categorisation of the energy sector into seven subsectors. Challenges and future requirements are explored for each of the sub-sectors, encompassing fossil fuels and nuclear energy to renewable energy sources and hydrogen, and from pure science to applied engineering. The study discusses the potential facilities to address these challenges within each sub-sector. It explores the e-infrastructure and data needs for the energy sector and provides a discussion on other sectors of the economy that energy research and innovation infrastructures contribute to. Some of the key messages identified in this study are the need for further large-scale initiative and large demonstrators of multi-vector energy systems, the need for multi-disciplinary research and innovation, and the need for greater data sharing and cyber-physical demonstrators. Finally, this work will serve as an important study to provide guidance for future investment strategy for the energy sector.

T1  - Thawing Permafrost as a Nitrogen Fertiliser: Implications for Climate Feedbacks
AN  - 2679827078
AB  - Studies for the northern high latitudes suggest that, in the near term, increased vegetation uptake may offset permafrost carbon losses, but over longer time periods, permafrost carbon decomposition causes a net loss of carbon. Here, we assess the impact of a coupled carbon and nitrogen cycle on the simulations of these carbon fluxes. We present results from JULES-IMOGEN—a global land surface model coupled to an intermediate complexity climate model with vertically resolved soil biogeochemistry. We quantify the impact of nitrogen fertilisation from thawing permafrost on the carbon cycle and compare it with the loss of permafrost carbon. Projections show that the additional fertilisation reduces the high latitude vegetation nitrogen limitation and causes an overall increase in vegetation carbon uptake. This is a few Petagrams of carbon (Pg C) by year 2100, increasing to up to 40 Pg C by year 2300 for the RCP8.5 concentration scenario and adds around 50% to the projected overall increase in vegetation carbon in that region. This nitrogen fertilisation results in a negative (stabilising) feedback on the global mean temperature, which could be equivalent in magnitude to the positive (destabilising) temperature feedback from the loss of permafrost carbon. This balance depends on the future scenario and initial permafrost carbon. JULES-IMOGEN describes one representation of the changes in Arctic carbon and nitrogen cycling in response to climate change. However there are uncertainties in the modelling framework, model parameterisation and missing processes which, when assessed, will provide a more complete picture of the balance between stabilising and destabilising feedbacks.

T1  - Ecological and Wildfire Responses to Rapid Landscape Changes within the Last ~900 Years on the South Haven Peninsula, Dorset (Southern England)
AN  - 2679788786
AB  - A multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental dataset (LOI, pollen, charcoal, grain sizes and the humification index) was extracted and radiocarbon dated from a sedimentary sequence from Spur Bog, central South Haven Peninsula (Dorset, southern England) to reconstruct ecological and environmental changes within the last ~900 years. These analyses reveal highly unstable environmental conditions at the site, evidencing the occurrence of multiple, often rapid changes during this period. The results significantly expand upon the existing palaeoenvironmental and geomorphological frameworks of the South Haven Peninsula which previously relied upon sparse, vague historical records prior to ~1750 AD. The multi-proxy dataset of Spur Bog sediments recorded a primary “development” phase (~1150–1470 AD) during which marine processes were the dominant control upon environmental conditions at the site, resulting in marked geomorphological changes that lead to the progressive eastward expansion of the South Haven Peninsula. This is followed by a secondary “maturation” phase (~1470–1880 AD) during which the Spur Bog sequence exhibits significant ecological changes in response to fluctuations in sea level, coastal erosion and human activity, demonstrating the vulnerability of the site to future climatic and anthropogenic pressures.

T1  - Soil-Improving Cropping Systems for Sustainable and Profitable Farming in Europe
AN  - 2679779985
AB  - Soils form the basis for agricultural production and other ecosystem services, and soil management should aim at improving their quality and resilience. Within the SoilCare project, the concept of soil-improving cropping systems (SICS) was developed as a holistic approach to facilitate the adoption of soil management that is sustainable and profitable. SICS selected with stakeholders were monitored and evaluated for environmental, sociocultural, and economic effects to determine profitability and sustainability. Monitoring results were upscaled to European level using modelling and Europe-wide data, and a mapping tool was developed to assist in selection of appropriate SICS across Europe. Furthermore, biophysical, sociocultural, economic, and policy reasons for (non)adoption were studied. Results at the plot/farm scale showed a small positive impact of SICS on environment and soil, no effect on sustainability, and small negative impacts on economic and sociocultural dimensions. Modelling showed that different SICS had different impacts across Europe—indicating the importance of understanding local dynamics in Europe-wide assessments. Work on adoption of SICS confirmed the role economic considerations play in the uptake of SICS, but also highlighted social factors such as trust. The project’s results underlined the need for policies that support and enable a transition to more sustainable agricultural practices in a coherent way.

T1  - Influence of Social, Environmental and Economic Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over Continuation of Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness
AN  - 2679745082
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were proposed in 2015 to promote worldwide improvements in human wellbeing. Governments have different levels of commitment to the SDGs, reflected in the SDG index, which shows the compliance of each country, detailing each score by SDG. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports show the advances of global entrepreneurship in various countries, while the Global Competitiveness Report shows their competitiveness. This analysis was based on environmental, social, and economic outcomes of SDGs from the SDG index 2018. We also evaluated data from the Global Competitiveness Report 2018 and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report 2018. A partial least-squares structural-equation-modeling technical analysis was used. It was found that social SDGs (0.796) and environmental SDGs (0.196) had a positive influence on economic SDGs; also, economic SDGs had a positive influence on the continuation of entrepreneurship (0.590) and competitiveness (0.918). The model explained 34.8% of the continuation of entrepreneurship and 84.3% of that of competitiveness. The outcomes of the bootstrapping test were used to evaluate whether the path coefficients were significant. This information can help governments and organizations to recognize the impact of support and promote compliance with SDGs and the continuation of entrepreneurship and competitiveness. Moreover, this information provides the means to analyze the influence of open innovation in accomplishing the SDGs faster. The study’s novelty is the use of the PLS-SEM technique to analyze these worldwide indicators.

T1  - Combining Temporal and Multi-Modal Approaches to Better Measure Accessibility to Banking Services
AN  - 2679738081
AB  - The UK, as elsewhere, has seen an accelerating trend of bank branch closures and reduced opening hours since the early 2000s. The reasons given by the banks are well rehearsed, but the impact assessments they provide to justify such programs and signpost alternatives have been widely criticized as being inadequate. This is particularly so for vulnerable customers dependent on financial services who may face difficulties in accessing remaining branches. There is a need whilst analyzing spatial patterns of access to also include temporal availability in relation to transport opportunities. Drawing on a case study of potential multi-modal accessibility to banks in Wales, we demonstrate how open-source tools can be used to examine patterns of access whilst considering the business operating hours of branches in relation to public transport schedules. The inclusion of public and private travel modes provides insights into access that are often overlooked by a consideration of service-side measures alone. Furthermore, findings from the types of tools developed in this study are illustrative of the additional information that could be included in holistic impact assessments, allowing the consequences of decisions being taken to close or reduce the operating hours of bank branches to be more clearly communicated to customers.

T1  - Value for Money: Local Authority Action on Clean Energy for Net Zero
AN  - 2679734022
AB  - Local authorities are well placed to realise co-benefits of integrated local energy systems; however, in the UK they have no statutory energy mandate. Planning and developing clean energy are discretionary, and persistent budget reductions, combined with the lack of strategic direction from the UK government for more localised energy provision, limit local capacity, expertise and resources. Nevertheless, some local authorities have led energy initiatives but have been unable to stimulate investment at the pace and scale required to align with net zero greenhouse gas targets. Using evidence from such initiatives, this paper discusses the institutional changes needed to enable local authorities to act. It examines existing climate and local energy plans, and their integral socio-economic value. Using this evidence, investment opportunities from locally led net zero programmes are identified. EU technical assistance funds provided a particularly successful route to local energy developments: based on value of investment secured against initial funding, it is estimated that GBP 1 million technical assistance funding to every local authority would lead to GBP 15 billion investment in local energy. Other potential funding innovations are assessed and the paper concludes with recommendations for policy and resource measures needed to convert local ambition into clean energy and energy saving investment at scale.

T1  - Exploring Environmental Health Inequalities: A Scientometric Analysis of Global Research Trends (1970–2020)
AN  - 2679731530
AB  - Environmental health inequalities (EHI), understood as differences in environmental health factors and in health outcomes caused by environmental conditions, are studied by a wide range of disciplines. This results in challenges to both synthesizing key knowledge domains of the field. This study aims to uncover the global research status and trends in EHI research, and to derive a conceptual framework for the underlying mechanisms of EHI. In total, 12,320 EHI publications were compiled from the Web of Science core collection from 1970 to 2020. Scientometric analysis was adopted to characterize the research activity, distribution, focus, and trends. Content analysis was conducted for the highlight work identified from network analysis. Keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis were applied to identify the knowledge domain and develop the EHI framework. The results show that there has been a steady increase in numbers of EHI publications, active journals, and involved disciplines, countries, and institutions since the 2000s, with marked differences between countries in the number of published articles and active institutions. In the recent decade, environment-related disciplines have gained importance in addition to social and health sciences. This study proposes a framework to conceptualize the multi-facetted issues in EHI research referring to existing key concepts.

T1  - Diffusion of Solar PV Energy in the UK: A Comparison of Sectoral Patterns
AN  - 2679707086
AB  - The paper applies innovation diffusion models to study the adoption process of solar PV energy in the UK from 2010 to 2021 by comparing the trajectories between three main categories, residential, commercial, and utility, in terms of both the number of installations and installed capacity data. The effect of the UK incentives on adoptions by those categories is studied by analyzing the timing, intensity, and persistence of the perturbations on adoption curves. The analysis confirms previous findings on PV adoption, namely the fragile role of the media support to solar PV, the ability of the proposed model to capture both the general trend of adoptions and the effects induced by ad hoc incentives, and the dramatic dependence of solar PV from public incentives. Thanks to the granularity of the data, the results reveal several interesting aspects, related both to differences in adoption patterns depending on the category considered, and to some regularities across categories. A comparison between the models for number of installations and for installed capacity data suggests that the latter (usually more easily available than the former) may be highly informative and, in some cases, may provide a reliable description of true adoption data.

T1  - Green Hydrogen in the UK: Progress and Prospects
AN  - 2679700508
AB  - Green hydrogen has been known in the UK since Robert Boyle described flammable air in 1671. This paper describes how green hydrogen has become a new priority for the UK in 2021, beginning to replace fossil hydrogen production exceeding 1 Mte in 2021 when the British Government started to inject significant funding into green hydrogen sources, though much less than the USA, Germany, Japan and China. Recent progress in the UK was initiated in 2008 when the first UK green hydrogen station opened in Birmingham University, refuelling 5 hydrogen fuel cell battery electric vehicles (HFCBEVs) for the 50 PhD chemical engineering students that arrived in 2009. Only 10 kg/day were required, in contrast to the first large, green ITM power station delivering almost 600 kg/day of green hydrogen that opened in the UK, in Tyseley, in July 2021. The first question asked in this paper is: ‘What do you mean, Green?’. Then, the Clean Air Zone (CAZ) in Birmingham is described, with the key innovations defined. Progress in UK green hydrogen and fuel cell introduction is then recounted. The remarks of Elon Musk about this ‘Fool Cell; Mind bogglingly stupid’ technology are analysed to show that he is incorrect. The immediate deployment of green hydrogen stations around the UK has been planned. Another century may be needed to make green hydrogen dominant across the country, yet we will be on the correct path, once a profitable supply chain is established in 2022.

T1  - Realising the Environmental Potential of Vertical Farming Systems through Advances in Plant Photobiology
AN  - 2679658524
AB  - Simple SummaryVertical farming systems (VFS) have great potential for improving crop productivity but are energy-intensive, since light, temperature, and humidity each need to be controlled. In this review, we consider the challenges of incorporating renewable energy into VFS and highlight how light spectra, intensity, and daylength can be varied to influence the quality of crops. We propose that insights from plant photobiology can be utilised to optimise energy efficiency in this rapidly evolving sector.AbstractIntensive agriculture is essential to feed increasing populations, yet requires large amounts of pesticide, fertiliser, and water to maintain productivity. One solution to mitigate these issues is the adoption of Vertical Farming Systems (VFS). The self-contained operation of these facilities offers the potential to recycle agricultural inputs, as well as sheltering crops from the effects of climate change. Recent technological advancements in light-emitting diode (LED) lighting technology have enabled VFS to become a commercial reality, although high electrical consumption continues to tarnish the environmental credentials of the industry. In this review, we examine how the inherent use of electricity by VFS can be leveraged to deliver commercial and environmental benefits. We propose that an understanding of plant photobiology can be used to vary VFS energy consumption in coordination with electrical availability from the grid, facilitating demand-side management of energy supplies and promoting crop yield.

T1  - The Criminogenic Nature of Food Production Harm Responses: A Case Study of Anaerobic Digestion Technology Subsidies in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2676133514
AB  - Meat production in its current shape is burdened with multiple environmental challenges. Technological solutions have been touted as a means of reconciliation of economic growth and environmental sustainability. In Northern Ireland, anaerobic digestion (AD) technology was presented as a solution for more sustainable animal waste management and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the context of the Going for Growth (GfG) agrifood strategy. AD sites were also eligible for the Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) subsidy support scheme. While criminological engagement with the issues around food crime is yet inchoate, even less attention has been paid to the issue of the criminogenic nature of responses to food production harm. The paper fills this lacuna by discussing how an ostensibly positive initiative of incentivising AD through subsidy provision may have criminogenic potential: it may exacerbate environmental harm due to its ineffectiveness for dealing with ammonia emissions from animal waste, and create opportunities for deviance, such as breaches in planning regulation and subsidy fraud.

T1  - Sustainable and Responsible Design Education: Tensions in Transitions
AN  - 2674416808
AB  - Sustainable and Responsible Design (SRD) harnesses design’s potential to address eco-social problems and in doing so challenge the status quo of design education by reframing the social and ecological consequences, boundaries and agencies of design. This critical and transdisciplinary approach frays the edges of traditional design disciplines with embedded and reflexive modes of learning. We describe characteristics of SRD education and present theories of learning to empower students in this complex terrain. The learning associated with SRD education is ecologically engaged, participative, critical, expansive and designerly. We recount case studies of our own experiences advancing sustainable and responsible undergraduate design education in the UK. We identify path constraints such as disciplinary fragility, appropriation, and power dynamics in the design school. The push for a revision of priorities generates tensions where there is often greenwashing rhetoric of sustainability and inclusivity. We describe strategies and tactics to address these tensions. We highlight the agency we have as educators and designers and argue that design education can only meaningfully participate in response to the challenges presented by climate change, other types of ecocide, and social problems when educators make substantive commitments to supporting sustainability literacies and design approaches that serve the interests of diverse stakeholders.

T1  - Measurements and Modelling of Vapour–Liquid Equilibrium for (H2O + N2) and (CO2 + H2O + N2) Systems at Temperatures between 323 and 473 K and Pressures up to 20 MPa
AN  - 2674356044
AB  - Understanding the phase behaviour of (CO2 + water + permanent gas) systems is critical for implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes, a key technology in reducing CO2 emissions. In this paper, phase behaviour data for (H2O + N2) and (CO2 + H2O + N2) systems are reported at temperatures from 323 to 473 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. In the ternary system, the mole ratio between CO2 and N2 was 1. Experiments were conducted in a newly designed analytical apparatus that includes two syringe pumps for fluid injection, a high-pressure equilibrium vessel, heater aluminium jacket, Rolsi sampling valves and an online gas chromatograph (GC) for composition determination. A high-sensitivity pulsed discharge detector installed in the GC was used to measure the low levels of dissolved nitrogen in the aqueous phase and low water levels in the vapour phase. The experimental data were compared with the calculation based on the γ-φ and SAFT-γ Mie approaches. In the SAFT-γ Mie model, the like parameters for N2 had to be determined. We also obtained the unlike dispersion energy for the (H2O + N2) system and the unlike repulsive exponent and dispersion energy for the (CO2 + N2) system. This was done to improve the prediction of SAFT-γ Mie model. For the (H2O + N2) binary system, the results show that the solubility of nitrogen in the aqueous phase was calculated better by the γ-φ approach rather than the SAFT-γ Mie model, whereas SAFT-γ Mie performed better for the prediction of the vapour phase. For the (CO2 + H2O + N2) ternary systems, both models predicted the experimental data for each phase with good agreement.

T1  - Cluster Analysis of Daily Cycling Flow Profiles during COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK
AN  - 2671095255
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government-enforced lockdown affected the travel behavior and lives of people worldwide. In this research, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is used to quantify the impact on daily flow profiles of cyclists due to the public’s response to different levels of restrictions during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. An inductive loop network in Tyne and Wear, the UK provided cycle flow data from 25 sites. A paired sample t-test was carried out between the “Pre-COVID-19” baseline year and 2020 to determine how cycling volumes changed at each site. The HCA was then performed on the diurnal hourly flow profiles to observe how they changed within the same time period. Finally, the relationship between diurnal flow profile and volume was assessed. Overall cycling volume in the study area increased by 38% during the lockdown. The highest increases were found at coastal sites, with more modest increases in suburban areas and reduced volumes at city center locations. The HCA of the diurnal flow profiles revealed that locations associated with noncommuting-shaped flows witnessed the largest increases while commuting profiles saw a decrease. As lockdown restrictions eased, flow profiles began to revert back to the prepandemic norm but never fully returned to prepandemic levels. The adoption of working from home postpandemic will change commuting behavior. The conclusions drawn from this study suggest consideration of noncommuting trips should be made when planning the design and location of future cycling schemes, and the HCA of flow profiles can assist in this decision-making process as a method to quantify changes in daily flow profiles of cycling.

T1  - Spatial and temporal data to study residential heat decarbonisation pathways in England and Wales
AN  - 2670512894
AB  - The decarbonisation of residential heating is crucial if the net-zero target in the United Kingdom is going to be achieved. This paper describes methods to produce data to quantify the impacts of residential heat decarbonisation on the energy supply infrastructure across England and Wales. For the year 2018, annual heat demand for a range of dwellings was estimated for almost 35,000 local areas (known as Lower Layer Super Output Areas: LSOAs). Energy savings through implementing the potential energy efficiency measures and the indicative costs of the energy efficiency measures were quantified. Profiles were synthesised for heat production and energy demand of selected heating technologies using average daily temperature and data from trial projects. These profiles were created to study the impacts of different types of heating technology in each LSOA under user-defined heat decarbonisation pathways. Data describing the dwelling stock, heating technologies, annual heat demand for each LSOA, indicative costs of energy efficiency improvements for each local authority and the profiles for each technology were created.Measurement(s)Annual heat demand • Half-hourly heat production of ASHPs, GSHPs, gas boilers and resistance heaters • Half-hourly energy consumption of ASHPs, GSHPs, gas boilers and resistance heaters • Costs of energy efficiencyTechnology Type(s)digital curation • supervised machine learningSample Characteristic - Environmentanthropogenic environmentSample Characteristic - LocationEngland • Wales

T1  - Integrative Sustainability Analysis of European Pig Farms: Development of a Multi-Criteria Assessment Tool
AN  - 2670473366
AB  - Societal interest in all aspects of sustainability has increased. Therefore, pig farmers need to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses in all dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, social wellbeing, and animal health and welfare. Our aim was to describe and critically discuss the development of a sustainability assessment tool for pig farms and to evaluate its suitability by applying it to 63 European pig farms (13 breeding, 27 breeding-to-finishing, and 23 finishing farms). The multi-criteria assessment tool was developed in several steps (the selection and scaling of indicators and their aggregation and weighting) in order to summarise the indicators into subtheme and theme scores. The indicators contributing the most to the subtheme/theme scores were identified and discussed in order to evaluate the procedure of the development. For example, some indicators, such as Ecological compensation area, Fairness of prices, and Tail docking, for which farms were scored low, were also identified as “real world problems” in other studies. For other sustainability aspects with low performance, the threshold might have been set too ambitiously, e.g., for Number of sows per annual working unit. Furthermore, to analyse the suitability of the tool, we assessed the best and worst median theme scores (good and poor performances) for each dimension, as well as the variability of the performances of the farms within the themes. Some themes were found to be moderate, such as Pig comfort, Biodiversity, or Resilience, whereas others were found to be good, e.g., Water and the Human–animal relationship, as well as several themes of the social wellbeing dimension. Overall, the sustainability tool provides a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of pig production. Furthermore, this publication contributes to both the theory (development of a robust sustainability tool) and the practice (provision of a tool to assess and benchmark the sustainability on farms). As a next step, a sensitivity analysis should be performed, and the tool should be applied for further development.

T1  - Designing Better Public Transport: Understanding Mode Choice Preferences Following the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2670464364
AB  - Transport behaviour has evidently changed following the COVID-19 pandemic, with lower usage across multiple modes of public transport and an increasing use of private vehicles. This is problematic as private vehicle use has been linked to an increase in traffic-related air pollutants, and consequently global warming and health-related issues. Hence, it is important to capture transport mode choice preferences following the pandemic, so that potential service changes can be made to address the lower usage. In total, 1138 respondents took part in an online discrete choice experiment methodology to quantify the utility of public transport service attributes in decision making around the choice of public transport. The data resulted in the development of three models using a multinomial logit model in R. For respondents on personal or commuting journeys, the mode of transport had no effect on utility. Results found that fare cost was the most important factor driving transport mode preference, when a range of choices were available. Following this, keeping fare cost consistent, faster journey times were preferred to stronger access to transport (i.e., through the provision of more bus stops/stations). The provision of operational relevant information to the journey was only significantly valued by commuters and travellers who could claim their journey as a business expense. Finally, when cost became less relevant (i.e., for travellers on expensed journeys), there was a significantly strong preference for taxi and road vehicle transport over all other transport modes. The results from this empirical research are discussed and the implications of recent transport policy are discussed, and recommendations of public transport service design are made.

T1  - Can Forel–Ule Index Act as a Proxy of Water Quality in Temperate Waters? Application of Plume Mapping in Liverpool Bay, UK
AN  - 2670389603
AB  - The use of ocean colour classification algorithms, linked to water quality gradients, can be a useful tool for mapping river plumes in both tropical and temperate systems. This approach has been applied in operational water quality programs in the Great Barrier Reef to map river plumes and assess trends in marine water composition and ecosystem health during flood periods. In this study, we used the Forel–Ule colour classification algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery in an automated process to map monthly, annual and long-term plume movement in the temperate coastal system of Liverpool Bay (UK). We compared monthly river plume extent to the river flow and in situ water quality data between 2017–2020. The results showed a strong positive correlation (Spearman’s rho = 0.68) between the river plume extent and the river flow and a strong link between the FUI defined waterbodies and nutrients, SPM, turbidity and salinity, hence the potential of the Forel–Ule index to act as a proxy for water quality in the temperate Liverpool Bay water. The paper discusses how the Forel–Ule index could be used in operational water quality programs to better understand river plumes and the land-based inputs to the coastal zones in UK waters, drawing parallels with methods that have been developed in the GBR and Citclops project. Overall, this paper provides the first insight into the systematic long-term river plume mapping in UK coastal waters using a fast, cost-effective, and reproducible workflow. The study created a novel water assessment typology based on the common physical, chemical and biological ocean colour properties captured in the Forel–Ule index, which could replace the more traditional eutrophication assessment regions centred around strict geographic and political boundaries. Additionally, the Forel–Ule assessment typology is particularly important since it identifies areas of the greatest impact from the land-based loads into the marine environment, and thus potential risks to vulnerable ecosystems.

T1  - Effectiveness and Economic Viability of Forest Certification: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2670177215
AB  - In the face of accelerating forest degradation and deforestation, forest certification emerged in the early 1990s as a voluntary and market-based mechanism to promote environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world’s forests. A key goal of forest certification is to reduce forest degradation and deforestation while enhancing forest enterprises’ economic viability. However, whether forest certification contributes to meeting such goals is unclear. We conducted a systematic literature review on such impacts, reviewing empirical studies published between 1993 and 2021 regarding the impact of forest certification on forest degradation, deforestation, and economic viability. Drawing on 98 empirical studies, we analyzed these impacts and provide an overview of the studies’ findings in terms of geographical distribution, indicators considered, and the certification schemes assessed. We found that the impact of forest certification on deforestation has been specifically understudied (n = 11) compared to forest degradation (n = 42) and economic viability (n = 45). On deforestation, studies have focused on Africa (45%) and South America (36%); on forest degradation, studies have focused on Europe (40%) and Asia (20%); on economic viability, studies have focused on Asia (33%), Europe (33%) and South America (20%). We found positive-neutral (54%; 46%) impacts on deforestation, positive-neutral-mixed (70%; 21%; 9%) impacts on forest degradation and positive-negative-mixed (50%; 33%; 17%) impacts on economic viability. We did not find clear evidence that impact is linked to a specific region or certification scheme. However, scarce evidence on the impacts of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the application of various methods, and site-specific indicators in the individual studies challenge such comparison and hamper the generalization of findings. This systematic review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the effectiveness and economic viability of forest certification, evaluates and discusses the current evidence base, and concludes with future research lines.

T1  - Residential Fuel Transition and Fuel Interchangeability in Current Self-Aspirating Combustion Applications: Historical Development and Future Expectations
AN  - 2670144371
AB  - To reduce greenhouse gases and air pollutants, new technologies are emerging to reduce fossil fuel usage and to adopt more renewable energy sources. As the major aspects of fuel consumption, power generation, transportation, and industrial applications have been given significant attention. The past few decades witnessed astonishing technological advancement in these energy sectors. In contrast, the residential sector has had relatively little attention despite its significant utilization of fuels for a much longer period. However, almost every energy transition in human history was initiated by the residential sector. For example, the transition from fuelwood to cheap coal in the 1700s first took place in residential houses due to urbanization and industrialization. The present review demonstrates the energy transitions in the residential sector during the past two centuries while portending an upcoming energy transition and future energy structure for the residential sector. The feasibility of the 100% electrification of residential buildings is discussed based on current residential appliance adoption, and the analysis indicates a hybrid residential energy structure is preferred over depending on a single energy source. Technical considerations and suggestions are given to help incorporate more renewable energy into the residential fuel supply system. Finally, it is observed that, compared to the numerous regulations on large energy-consumption aspects, standards for residential appliances are scarce. Therefore, it is concluded that establishing appropriate testing methods is a critical enabling step to facilitate the adoption of renewable fuels in future appliances.

T1  - Are companies using Twitter to greenwash and hide bad environmental performance?
AN  - 2665136969
AB  - Companies and related consumer behaviours contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. However, consumer behaviour is shifting, with the public now recognising the real and immediate impact of climate change. Many companies are aware and seemingly eager to align to consumer’s increasing environmental consciousness, yet there is a risk that some companies could be presenting themselves as environmentally friendly without implementing environmentally beneficial processes and products (i.e. greenwashing). Here, using longitudinal climate leadership, environmental messaging (Twitter) and stock price data, we explore how climate leadership (a relative climate change mitigation metric) and environmental messaging have changed for hundreds of UK companies. Using the environmental messaging, we also assess whether companies are simply greenwashing their true climate change performance. Finally, we explore how climate leadership and environmental messaging influence companies’ stock prices. We found that companies (on average) have increased their climate leadership (coef: 0.14, CI 0.12–0.16) and environmental messaging (coef: 0.35, CI 0.19–0.50) between 2010 and 2019. We also found an association where companies with more environmental messaging had a higher climate leadership (coef: 0.16, CI 0.07–0.26), suggesting messaging was proportionate to environmental performance, and so there was no clear pattern of using Twitter for greenwashing across UK companies. In fact, some companies may be under-advertising their pro-environmental performance. Finally, we found no evidence that climate leadership, environmental messaging or greenwashing impacts a company’s stock price.

T1  - Embodied Energy Consumption in the Residential Sector: A Case Study of Affordable Housing
AN  - 2663113019
AB  - Embodied energy has a significant effect on the total environmental impact of a project. However, emphasis is often placed primarily on operational energy, resulting in a knowledge gap about the current state of embodied energy use in affordable housing. To address this, the study investigates the level of embodied energy consumption in affordable housing, as well as the drivers, barriers, and techniques to reduce embodied energy. Based on a single embedded case study covering the period from cradle to end of construction, data were collected using embodied energy calculations of three affordable housing units in the project, semi-structured interviews with five design team members, and a cross-examination of findings with contract documents. The results were analysed using sensitivity analysis and thematic analysis. The findings revealed that all three house units fulfilled the baseline embodied carbon target of 800 kg CO2/m2 and both detached properties fell within the LETI (2020) target of 500 kg CO2/m2. However, all three properties would fail to meet the RIBA or 2030 LETI target of 300 kg CO2/m2. This suggests that improvements are necessary to achieve future targets. The results show that financial capabilities and operational energy prioritisation act as the main enabler and barrier for reducing embodied energy. Local contractors/suppliers, minimising material use or intensity, and modular construction were highlighted as the key reduction techniques that can be used to help achieve future targets concerning embodied carbon in residential developments. The study contributes significantly to understanding the current state of embodied energy use in affordable housing and provides new insights on how to deal with embodied energy if we are to meet future energy targets.

T1  - Understanding Cannabis sativa L.: Current Status of Propagation, Use, Legalization, and Haploid-Inducer-Mediated Genetic Engineering
AN  - 2663082112
AB  - Cannabis sativa L. is an illegal plant in many countries. The worldwide criminalization of the plant has for many years limited its research. Consequently, understanding the full scope of its benefits and harm became limited too. However, in recent years the world has witnessed an increased pace in legalization and decriminalization of C. sativa. This has prompted an increase in scientific studies on various aspects of the plant’s growth, development, and use. This review brings together the historical and current information about the plant’s relationship with mankind. We highlight the important aspects of C. sativa classification and identification, carefully analyzing the supporting arguments for both monotypic (single species) and polytypic (multiple species) perspectives. The review also identifies recent studies on suitable conditions and methods for C. sativa propagation as well as highlighting the diverse uses of the plant. Specifically, we describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the prominent phytocannabinoids and provide status of the studies on heterologous synthesis of phytocannabinoids in different biological systems. With a historical view on C. sativa legality, the review also provides an up-to-date worldwide standpoint on its regulation. Finally, we present a summary of the studies on genome editing and suggest areas for future research.

T1  - Predicting Energy Savings of the UK Housing Stock under a Step-by-Step Energy Retrofit Scenario towards Net-Zero
AN  - 2663010851
AB  - The UK has one of the least energy-efficient housing stocks in Europe. By 2030, the emissions from UK homes need to fall by at least 24% from 1990 levels to meet the UK’s ambitious goal, which is reaching net-zero emissions. The originality of this paper is to apply the building typology approach to predict energy savings of the UK housing stock under a step-by-step energy retrofit scenario, targeting the Passive House Standard for refurbishments of existing buildings, namely the EnerPHit “Quality-Approved Energy Retrofit with Passive House Components.” The typologies consist of twenty reference buildings, representative of five construction ages and four building sizes. The energy balance of the UK residential buildings was created and validated against statistical data. A building stock retrofit plan specifying the order in which to apply energy efficiency measures was elaborated, and energy savings were calculated. The predicted total energy demand for the UK residential building stock for the year 2022 is 37.7 MTOE, and the carbon emissions estimation is 65.33 MtCO2e. The energy-saving potential is 87%, and carbon reductions are about 76%, considering all the steps of renovation applied. It has been demonstrated that the step that provides the biggest savings across the housing stock is the one that involves replacing windows, draught-proofing, and installing mechanical ventilation with heat recovery.

T1  - On the Development of Offshore Wind Turbine Technology: An Assessment of Reliability Rates and Fault Detection Methods in a Changing Market
AN  - 2663003554
AB  - Offshore wind turbine drive train technology is evolving as developers increase size, aim to maximise availability and adapt to changing electricity grid requirements. This work first of all explores offshore technology market trends observed in Europe, providing a comprehensive overview of installed and planned capacity, showing a clear shift from smaller high-speed geared machines to larger direct-drive machines. To examine the implications of this shift in technology on reliability, stop rates for direct-drive and gear-driven turbines are compared between 39 farms across Europe and South America. This showed several key similarities between configurations, with the electrical system contributing to largest amount of turbine downtime in either case. When considering overall downtime across all components, the direct-drive machine had the highest value, which could be mainly attributed to comparatively higher downtime associated with the electrical, generator and control systems. For this study, downtime related to the gearbox and generator of the gear-driven turbine was calculated at approximately half of that of the direct-drive generator downtime. Finally, from a perspective of both reliability and fault diagnostics at component level, it is important to understand the key similarities and differences that would allow lessons learned on older technology to be adapted and transferred to newer models. This work presents a framework for assessing diagnostic models published in the literature, more specifically whether a particular failure mode and required input data will transfer well between geared and direct-drive machines. Results from 35 models found in the literature shows that the most transferable diagnostic models relate to the hydraulic, pitch and yaw systems, while the least transferable models relate to the gearbox. Faults associated with the generator, shafts and bearings are failure mode specific, but generally require some level of modification to adapt features to available data.

T1  - A Qualitative Based Causal-Loop Diagram for Understanding Policy Design Challenges for a Sustainable Transition Pathway: The Case of Tees Valley Region, UK
AN  - 2653040613
AB  - The energy transition is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive and structured approach to policymaking. Such an approach is needed to ensure that transition pathways and policies enable greener energy alternatives whilst ensuring prosperity for people living in the region and limiting environmental degradation to the local ecosystem. This paper applies a qualitative approach based on systematic literature research and review analysis to identify and analyse previous work within this interdisciplinary field in order to understand the complexity of energy transitions and identify key variables and sub-sectors that need to be addressed by policymaking. The paper then looks at the problem from a regional level and uses the Tees Valley region in North East England as a reference case for the energy system and potential proposed policies for the energy transition. A system dynamics methodology was employed to help visualise and emphasise the major complexity of the energy transition and the challenges that policymaking needs to tackle for the successfully enable implementation and application of the energy transition policies. The results of this study identified that in relation to the Tees Valley energy system, its development and transition towards decarbonisation, the major challenge for the policymakers is to ensure that proposed policies foster growth in job creation without leading to job losses within the local employment market.

T1  - Sustainable Catchment-Wide Flood Management: A Review of the Terminology and Application of Sustainable Catchment Flood Management Techniques in the UK
AN  - 2653035541
AB  - Climate change has seen increased pressures put on the existing ageing flood mitigation infrastructure. As a result, over recent decades there has been a shift from traditional hard-engineered approaches to flooding to more sustainable methods that utilise nature-based processes in order to slow flow, store water and increase infiltration. Doing so has resulted in a range of different nomenclature for such techniques, particularly in the rural environment. This paper takes a critical review of such terms to draw parallels in the different approaches, with the aim of developing a more unified, consistent approach to flood management. Furthermore, links have been drawn with the urban environment, where Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) are used as a sustainable approach to urban flooding. The findings from this review have identified a series of issues that result from the current UK approach of differentiating between urban and rural flood risk, with funding often given for Natural Flood Management (NFM) projects separately to SuDS, with little integrated thinking from source to sea. Hence, the review suggests (1) a greater consideration of scale, focusing on the catchment as a whole, is required to ensure a more holistic approach to flood management, under the phrase “sustainable catchment-wide flood management”, to ensure that the focus shifts from NFM (rural) and SuDS (urban), to a more integrated catchment-wide approach; (2) the development of robust policy and regulatory framework, to ensure that such an approach is more widely adopted; (3) a greater consideration of the long-term costs is also required, with future research needed on the long-term maintenance costs of different methods; (4) the development of modelling approaches that can simulate flow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, to support stakeholders, such as local authorities, flood risk engineers and government agencies when considering flow not only in rural areas, but also to understand the impact beyond the immediate area around the scheme.

T1  - Leaf and Branch Hydraulic Plasticity of Two Light-Demanding Broadleaved Tree Species Differing in Water-Use Strategy
AN  - 2652966803
AB  - Global climate change creates new environmental scenarios and selective pressures; thus, a better understanding of the plasticity of plant functional traits is needed to predict how plant species will respond to shifts in climate. Among the important functional traits for plants are their hydraulic properties which ultimately determine their photosynthetic capacity, growth rate, and survival in a changing environment. In this study, the light sensitivity of leaf (KL) and branch hydraulic conductance (KB) to fast changes in irradiance, and hydraulic plasticity (PIh) was studied in two broadleaved tree species differing in water-use strategy—silver birch (Betula pendula) and hybrid aspen (Populus × wettsteinii). The KL increased by a factor of 3.5 and 1.5 from minimal values recorded in darkness to maximal values in high light conditions for birch and aspen, respectively, indicating a significantly higher PIh for birch (0.72) than for aspen leaves (0.35). KB increased 1.5-fold from dark to light conditions for both species. The high light sensitivity of KL and KB provides a regulatory mechanism to maintain a balance between transpirational demand and hydraulic supply. The plasticity of these traits increases the ability of plants to cope with a rapidly changing environment and to adapt to global climate change.

T1  - Thermal management of electrical machines for propulsion – challenges and future trends
AN  - 2650257286
AB  - The continuous drive towards electrified propulsion systems has been imposing ever more demanding performance and cost targets for the future power electronics, machines and drives (PEMDs). This is particularly evident when exploring various technology road mapping documents both for automotive and aerospace industries, e.g. Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) UK, Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) UK, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) USA and others. In that context, a significant improvement of the specific performance and cost measures, e.g. power density increase by a factor of 10 or more and/or cost per power unit reduction by 50% or better, is forecasted for the next 5 to 15 years. However, the existing PEMD solutions are already at their technological limits to some degree. Consequently, meeting the performance and cost step change would require a considerable development effort. This paper is focused on electrical machines and their thermal management, which has been recognised as one of key enabling factors for delivering high specific output solutions. The challenges associated with heat removal in electrical machines are discussed in detail, alongside with new concepts of thermal management systems. Several examples from the available literature are presented. These include manufacturing techniques, new materials and novel integrated designs in application to electrical machines.

T1  - Enabling Sustainable Lifestyles in New Urban Areas: Evaluation of an Eco-Development Case Study in the UK
AN  - 2649107220
AB  - This study evaluated the actual environmental behaviours in an eco-development case study in the UK, which was designed to enable more sustainable lifestyles. Data analysis was based on the resident responses to a development-wide questionnaire survey (n = 89), household interviews (n = 12) and waste measurements. Reported energy- and water-saving behaviours were fairly common. The mean waste recycling rates (45% to 60%) were similar to local and national averages, and were below the target of 80%. The mean rates of purchasing organic food (37%), growing food (31%) and meat consumption (in 36% of all meals) indicated that the food behaviours were not more pro-environmental. Car-based modes of transportation were used for 71% of all the reported trips on average, which was higher than the national average, and the target of 55%. Despite these reported behaviours, most of the residents regarded their new lifestyles as more sustainable. This was related to the notion of energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies, rather than changes in behaviour. The findings of this study and similar studies indicated that enabling environmental behaviours in new developments is challenging. New policies need to be more holistic and support the delivery of not only well-performing buildings, but also developments that make sustainable urban living a reality.

T1  - Gaps in Regulation and Policies on the Application of Green Technologies at Household Level in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2649099961
AB  - Green technologies (Green-Tech) are solutions aiming to mitigate or reverse the effects of human activity on the environment. The United Kingdom (UK) government established a Ten-Point Plan and over GBP 5 billion to support Green-Tech to lay the foundations for a green industrial revolution and reduce emissions by 180 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2032. Households and buildings contribute around 40% of the UK’s total GHG emissions, which implies that key actions are needed in all areas around the building sector (Point 7). This study provides an overview and analysis of the existing regulation and standards in the UK building/household sector, to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify gaps preventing Green-Tech wider implementation and use. Discrepancies in regulation and standards were identified. Given that households bring together and adhere to numerous standards and regulations, the analysis highlighted that it is critical to formulate relevant actions starting from the individuals with engagement and information. Complete and clear guidelines addressing environmental awareness, the performance and economical convenience of Green-Tech implementation and related regulations, are required to come to a consensus on the best way to move forward to achieve sustainability and NET-ZERO targets.

T1  - The Role of Electric Vehicle Charging Technologies in the Decarbonisation of the Energy Grid
AN  - 2649021700
AB  - Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has been identified as a key technology to help reduce carbon emissions from the transport and energy sectors. However, the benefits of this technology are best achieved when multiple variables are considered in the process of charging and discharging an electric vehicle. These variables include vehicle behaviour, building energy demand, renewable energy generation, and grid carbon intensity. It is expected that the transition to electric mobility will add pressure to the energy grid. Using the batteries of electric vehicles as energy storage to send energy back to the grid during high-demand, carbon-intensive periods will help to reduce the impact of introducing electric vehicles and minimise carbon emissions of the system. In this paper, the authors present a method and propose a V2G control scheme integrating one year of historical vehicle and energy datasets, aiming towards carbon emissions reduction through increased local consumption of renewable energy, offset of vehicle charging demand to low carbon intensity periods, and offset of local building demand from peak and carbon-intensive periods through storage in the vehicle battery. The study included assessment of strategic location and the number of chargers to support a fleet of five vehicles to make the transition to electric mobility and integrate vehicle-to-grid without impacting current service provision. The authors found that the proposed V2G scheme helped to reduce the average carbon intensity per kilowatt (gCO2/kWh) in simulation scenarios, despite the increased energy demand from electric vehicles charging. For instance, in one of the tested scenarios V2G reduced the average carbon intensity per kilowatt from 223.8 gCO2/kWh with unmanaged charging to 218.9 gCO2/kWh using V2G.

T1  - Operational Emissions in Prosuming Dwellings: A Study Comparing Different Sources of Grid CO2 Intensity Values in South Wales, UK
AN  - 2649006288
AB  - This paper analysed operational CO2 emissions from electricity grid interaction in photovoltaic prosumer dwellings in South Wales, UK. Operational CO2 emissions were quantified in four prosumer dwellings aiming to analyse (1) the differences in the result when time-varying data and static emission factors are used, and (2) the association of load-matching indicators to the results. Electricity balance data were obtained through monitoring (April 2020 to March 2021), and three sources for the grid’s CO2 intensity were considered: (1) UK nationwide average time-varying values (UK), (2) South Wales (SW) average time-varying values and (3) the UK Government’s official CO2 emissions factor (EF) for the study period. UK and SW grid CO2 intensity were obtained as dynamic data flows in a 30 min resolution, whereas EF was a year constant. Gross CO2 emissions calculated using SW data reached the highest emissions results: between 67.5% and 69.3% higher than the results obtained using the UK time-varying data, and between 41.1% and 45.1% higher than using the EF. The differences between the obtained yearly net emissions using dynamic data and the EF in each studied dwelling ranged between 6.2% and 294%. Results also show that the definition of geographic boundaries for location-based approach calculations can significantly affect the obtained emissions values.

T1  - Relationships between Recreation and Pollution When Striving for Wellbeing in Blue Spaces
AN  - 2649006106
AB  - Our aim for this research was to identify and examine how recreation enthusiasts cope with and mitigate the violence of pollution as they strive for wellbeing in polluted “blue spaces” (e.g., seas, oceans). Our methodology to undertake the research was ethnography (online and offline), including autoethnography and informal interviews (40). The study proceeded from a constructivist epistemology which emphasizes that knowledge is situated and perspectival. The study site was a post-industrial area of northeast England where a long-standing but also rapidly growing surfing culture has to live with pollution (legacy and ongoing). We found evidence of what have become quotidian tactics that attach to themes of familiarity, embodiment, resignation, denial, and affect/emotion used by enthusiasts to cope with and mitigate the violence of pollution. We argue that by necessity some surfers are persisting in striving for wellbeing not simply in spite of pollution but rather with pollution. We assert surfers enact a “resigned activism” that influences their persistence. We extend critical scholarship concerning relationships between recreation, blue spaces, and wellbeing by moving beyond a restrictive binary of focusing on either threats and risks or opportunities and benefits of blue space to health and wellbeing, instead showing how striving for wellbeing through recreation in the presence of pollution provides evidence of how such efforts are more negotiated, fluid, situated, uncertain, dissonant, and even political than any such binary structure allows for.

T1  - Reusing Fe water treatment residual as a soil amendment to improve physical function and flood resilience
AN  - 2647605238
AB  - Soil degradation is a global challenge that is intrinsically linked to climate change and food security. Soil degradation has many causes, but all degraded soils suffer from poor soil structure. The increasing global production of water treatment residual (WTR), an organo-mineral waste product from clean water treatment, means that the sustainable reuse of this waste provides a potential timely opportunity, as research has shown that WTR application to soil can improve soil health. Recycling or reuse of WTR to land is commonplace across the world but is subject to limitations based on the chemical properties of the material. Very little work has focused on the physical impacts of WTR application and its potential to rebuild soil structure, particularly improving its ability to hold water and resist the effects of flooding. This paper presents novel research in which the use of Fe WTR and Fe WTR / compost [1 : 1] co-amendment has shown to be beneficial for a soil's water retention, permeability, volume change, and strength properties, all critical in soil health. Application rates of WTR were 10 %–30 % by dry mass. Compared with the control sandy loam soil, co-amended samples have 5.7 times the hydraulic conductivity (570 % improvement), 54 % higher shear strength, and 25 % greater saturated water content. Single WTR-amended soil had 26 times the saturated hydraulic conductivity (2600 % improvement), 129 % higher shear strength, and 13.7 % greater saturated water content. Data indicate that Fe WTR can be added as a single amendment to significantly improve soil physical characteristics where shear strength and hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors in application. Although the co-application of Fe WTR with compost provides a lesser improvement in shear strength and hydraulic conductivity compared with single WTR amendment, the co-amendment has the best water retention properties and provides supplementary organic content, which is beneficial for environmental applications where the soil health (i.e. ability to sustain ecosystem functions and support plants) is critical.

T1  - Rapid linear transport infrastructure development in the Carpathians: A major threat to the integrity of ecological connectivity for large carnivores
AN  - 2643406922
AB  - The development of sustainable transport is a key challenge in societies where there is an accelerated need for socio-economic development. This is the case for seven countries from central and south-eastern Europe that share the Carpathian Mountains. The challenge of developing sustainable transport requires transdisciplinary, or at least cross-sectoral cooperation, between the transport development and nature conservation sectors. Such cooperation is not in the culture of the Carpathian countries, which together host some of the most remarkable biodiversity values in Europe, including the largest populations of brown bear, grey wolf and Eurasian lynx . The overall length of motorways in these countries more than quintupled in the last 30 years and the rapid expansion of Linear Transport Infrastructure (LTI) continues at exacerbating rates. The rich biodiversity habitats are being fragmented and the concept of ecological connectivity is poorly understood and implemented by the national authorities. Ecological networks for large carnivores are not defined nor officially recognised in the Carpathian countries, with little exceptions. The legislation is not consistent across the strands of ecological connectivity and is not harmonised between the countries to effectively support transnational conservation efforts. Thus, the critical intersections between planned or even existing LTI and ecological corridors for large carnivores cannot be identified, in most cases leading to increasing habitat fragmentation and isolation of wildlife populations in the region. We summarised all this key context-related information for the Carpathians in relation to LTI development and ecological connectivity. To counteract this trend in the Carpathian ecoregion, we propose a set of recommendations to: improve and harmonise the legislation; develop and endorse methodologies for designating ecological corridors; address the cumulative impact on ecological connectivity; define other threats on landscape permeability; improve stakeholder engagement, cooperation and communication; develop comprehensive and transparent biodiversity and transport databases; monitor wildlife and transport for implementing most appropriate mitigation measures and strategies; build capacity to address the issue of sustainable transportation; and foster transnational cooperation and dialogue. Bringing these elements together will support the design of ecological networks in a way that considers the needs and location of both current and future habitats and contribute to efforts to address the climate crisis. These specific recommendations are relevant also for other areas of the world facing similar problems as the Carpathians.

T1  - The Impact of Tree Planting on Infiltration Dependent on Tree Proximity and Maturity at a Clay Site in Warwickshire, England
AN  - 2642684928
AB  - Urbanisation and the replacement of previously vegetated areas with impermeable surfaces reduces the lag times of overland flow and increases peak flows to receiving watercourses; the magnitude of this will increase as a result of climate change. Tree planting is gaining momentum as a potential method of natural flood management (NFM) due to its ability to break up soil and increase infiltration and water storage. In this study, a 2.2 km2 clay-textured area in Warwickshire, England, planted with trees every year from 2006 to 2012 was sampled to investigate how infiltration varies dependent on season and tree proximity and maturity. Infiltration data was collected from 10 and 200 cm away from selected sample trees from November 2019 to August 2021 using a Mini Disk infiltrometer (MDI). The results show that mean infiltration is higher at the 10 cm proximity compared with the 200 cm proximity by 75.87% in winter and 25.19% in summer. Further to this, mean 10 cm infiltration is 192% higher in summer compared with winter, and mean 200 cm infiltration is 310% higher in summer compared with winter. There is little evidence to suggest a relationship between infiltration and tree maturity at the study site.

T1  - UK Government Policy and the Transition to a Circular Nutrient Economy
AN  - 2642630792
AB  - The “circular economy” is an increasingly influential concept linking economic and environmental policy to enable sustainable use of resources. A crucial although often overlooked element of this concept is a circular nutrient economy, which is an economy that achieves the minimization of nutrient losses during the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of food and other products, as well as the comprehensive recovery of nutrients from organic residuals at each of these stages for reuse in agricultural production. There are multiple interconnecting barriers to transitioning from the current linear economic system to a more circular one, requiring strongly directional government policy. This paper uses interpretive policy analysis to review six UK government strategies to assess their strengths and weaknesses in embracing nutrient circularisation. Our analysis highlights the acute underrepresentation of the circular nutrient economy concept in these strategies as well as the potential to reorient the current policy towards its development. We find significant barriers to transition presented by ambiguity in key policy terms and proposals, the use of inappropriate indicators, the lack of a systematic approach to key sustainability objectives, and the presence of a “techno-optimist imaginary” throughout the strategies. We develop these findings to make recommendations to help integrate definitions, objectives, and activities across the policy domains necessary for the operational development of a circular nutrient economy.

T1  - Utilization of Biomasses from Landscape Conservation Growths Dominated by Common Ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertn.) for Biomethanization
AN  - 2642561108
AB  - The highly toxic species common ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertn.) prefers to migrate into protected dry grassland biotopes and limits the use of the resulting biomass as animal feed. There is an urgent need for a safe alternative use of the contaminated biomass apart from landfill disposal. We investigated the optional utilization of biomethanization of fresh and ensiled common ragwort biomasses and evaluated their energetic potentials by estimation models based on biochemical characteristics and by standardized batch experiments. The fresh and ensiled substrates yielded 174 LN∙kg−1 oDM methane and 185 LN∙kg−1 oDM, respectively. Ensiling reduced the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid content by 76.6%; a subsequent wet fermentation for an additional reduction is recommended. In comparison with other biomasses from landscape cultivation, ragwort biomass can be ensiled readily but has a limited energy potential if harvested at its peak flowering stage. Considering these properties and limitations, the energetic utilization is a promising option for a sustainable handling of Senecio-contaminated biomasses in landscape conservation practice and represents a safe alternative for reducing pyrrolizidine alkaloid entry into the agri-food sector.

T1  - Eco-Capabilities as a Pathway to Wellbeing and Sustainability
AN  - 2642485348
AB  - Eco-Capabilities is an AHRC funded project situated at the intersection of three issues: a concern with children’s wellbeing; their disconnect with the environment; and a lack of engagement with arts in school curricula. It builds on Amartya Sen’s work on human capabilities as a proxy for wellbeing, developing the term eco-capabilities to describe how children define what they feel they need to live a fully good human life through environmental sustainability, social justice and future economic wellbeing. A total of 101 children aged 7–10 from schools in highly deprived areas participated in eight full days of arts in nature practice. The study drew on arts based research methods, participatory observations, interviews and focus groups with artists, teachers and children. Findings suggest that arts in nature practice contributed towards eight (eco-)capabilities: autonomy; bodily integrity and safety; individuality; mental and emotional wellbeing; relationality: human/nonhuman relations; senses and imagination; and spirituality. This was facilitated through four pedagogical elements: extended and repeated arts in nature sessions; embodiment and engaging children affectively through the senses; ‘slowliness’, which envelops children with time and space to (re)connect; and thoughtful practice, which facilitates emotional expression. We suggest that, through these elements, arts in nature practice supports children’s wellbeing, and guides them towards a more entangled relationship with nature and a clearer understanding of themselves as part of it, thereby motivating them to take better care of it.

T1  - Inclusive Design of Workspaces: Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding Users
AN  - 2642482549
AB  - Accessible design within the built environment has often focused on mobility conditions and has recently widened to include mental health. Additionally, as one in seven are neurodivergent (including conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and dyspraxia), this highlights a growing need for designing for ‘non-visible’ conditions in addition to mobility. Emphasised by the growing disability pay gap and the disability perception gap, people with disabilities are still facing discrimination and physical barriers within the workplace. This research aimed to identify key ways of reducing physical barriers faced by people with a disability and thus encourage more comfortable and productive use of workspaces for all. Once the need for designing for a spectrum of users and inclusive workspace design was understood, a survey was then circulated to students and staff at a large university in the UK (working remotely from home), with the aim of understanding how people have adapted their home spaces and what barriers they continue to face. Quantitative and qualitative results were compared to the literature read with key issues emerging, such as separating work and rest from spaces in bedrooms. The survey findings and literature were evaluated, extracting key performance-based goals (e.g., productivity and focus within a study space) and prescriptive design features (e.g., lighting, furniture, and thermal comfort), whilst also considering the inclusivity of these features. The key conclusion establishes that, to achieve maximum benefit, it is important to work with the users to understand specific needs and identify creative and inclusive solutions.

T1  - ‘It All Kind of Links Really’: Young People’s Perspectives on the Relationship between Socioeconomic Circumstances and Health
AN  - 2642454842
AB  - Meaningful inclusion of young people’s perceptions and experiences of inequalities is argued to be critical in the development of pro-equity policies. Our study explored young people’s perceptions of what influences their opportunities to be healthy within their local area and their understandings of health inequalities. Three interlinked qualitative focus group discussions, each lasting 90 to 100 min, with the same six groups of young people (n = 42) aged 13–21, were conducted between February and June 2021. Participants were recruited from six youth groups in areas of high deprivation across three geographical locations in England (South Yorkshire, the North East and London). Our study demonstrates that young people understand that health inequalities are generated by social determinants of health, which in turn influence behaviours. They highlight a complex interweaving of pathways between social determinants and health outcomes. However, they do not tend to think in terms of the social determinants and their distribution as resulting from the power and influence of those who create and benefit from health and social inequalities. An informed understanding of the causes of health inequalities, influenced by their own unique generational experiences, is important to help young people contribute to the development of pro-equity policies of the future.

T1  - Thermal and Economic Analysis of Heat Exchangers as Part of a Geothermal District Heating Scheme in the Cheshire Basin, UK
AN  - 2642428693
AB  - Heat exchangers are vital to any geothermal system looking to use direct heat supplied via a district heat network. Attention on geothermal schemes in the UK has been growing, with minimal attention on the performance of heat exchangers. In this study, different types of heat exchangers are analysed for the Cheshire Basin as a case study, specifically the Crewe area, to establish their effectiveness and optimal heat transfer area. The results indicate that counter-current flow heat exchangers have a higher effectiveness than co-current heat exchangers. Optimisation of the heat exchange area can produce total savings of £43.06 million and £71.5 million, over a 25-year lifetime, in comparison with a fossil-fuelled district heat network using geothermal fluid input temperatures of 67 °C and 86 °C, respectively.

T1  - Adopting a Whole Systems Approach to Transport Decarbonisation, Air Quality and Health: An Online Participatory Systems Mapping Case Study in the UK
AN  - 2642334838
AB  - In a drive to achieve net zero emissions, U.K. transport decarbonisation policies are predominantly focussed on measures to promote the uptake and use of electric vehicles (EVs). This is reflected in the COP26 Transport Declaration signed by 38 national governments, alongside city region governments, vehicle manufacturers and investors. However, emerging evidence suggests that EVs present multiple challenges for air quality, mobility and health, including risks from non-exhaust emissions (NEEs) and increasing reliance on vehicles for short trips. Understanding the interconnected links between electric mobility, human health and the environment, including synergies and trade-offs, requires a whole systems approach to transport policymaking. In the present paper, we describe the use of Participatory Systems Mapping (PSM) in which a diverse group of stakeholders collaboratively constructed a causal model of the U.K. surface transport system through a series of interactive online workshops. We present the map and its analysis, with our findings illustrating how unintended consequences of EV-focussed transport policies may have an impact on air quality, human health and important social functions of the transport system. We conclude by considering how online participatory causal modelling techniques could be effectively integrated with empirical metrics to facilitate effective policy design and appraisal in the transport sector.

T1  - Nutritional Benefits from Fatty Acids in Organic and Grass-Fed Beef
AN  - 2638575815
AB  - Livestock production is under increasing scrutiny as a component of the food supply chain with a large impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Amidst growing calls to reduce industrial ruminant production, there is room to consider differences in meat quality and nutritional benefits of organic and/or pasture-based management systems. Access to forage, whether fresh or conserved, is a key influencing factor for meat fatty acid profile, and there is increasing evidence that pasture access is particularly beneficial for meat’s nutritional quality. These composition differences ultimately impact nutrient supply to consumers of conventional, organic and grass-fed meat. For this review, predicted fatty acid supply from three consumption scenarios were modelled: i. average UK population National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) (<128 g/week) red meat consumption, ii. red meat consumption suggested by the UK National Health Service (NHS) (<490 g/week) and iii. red meat consumption suggested by the Eat Lancet Report (<98 g/week). The results indicate average consumers would receive more of the beneficial fatty acids for human health (especially the essential omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid) from pasture-fed beef, produced either organically or conventionally.

T1  - Deriving Current Cost Requirements from Future Targets: Case Studies for Emerging Offshore Renewable Energy Technologies
AN  - 2637689812
AB  - This work investigates potential cost reduction trajectories of three emerging offshore renewable energy technologies (floating offshore wind, tidal stream, and wave) with respect to meeting ambitious cost targets set out in the Strategic Energy Technology Implementation Plans (SET-Plans) for Offshore Wind and Ocean Energy. A methodology is presented which calculates target costs for current early-stage devices, starting from the 2030 SET-Plan levelised cost targets. Component-based experience curves have been applied as part of the methodology, characterised through the comparative maturity level of each technology-specific cost centre. The resultant early-stage target costs are then compared with actual costs for current devices to highlight where further cost reduction is still required. It has been found that innovation and development requirements to reach these targets vary greatly between different technologies, based on their current level of technological maturity. Future funding calls and programmes should be designed with these variables in mind to support innovative developments in offshore renewables. The method presented in this paper has been applied to publicly available cost data for emerging renewable technologies and is fully adaptable to calculate the innovation requirements for specific early-stage renewable energy devices.

T1  - An Evaluation of the Impact of Databases on End-of-Life Embodied Carbon Estimation
AN  - 2633184869
AB  - The growing awareness of the need to minimise greenhouse gas (GHG) and mitigate climate change has resulted in a greater focus on the embodied carbon (EC) of construction material. One way to ensure the environmental impact of building activities is minimised to a reasonable level is the calculation of their EC. Whilst there are a few studies investigating the role of embodied carbon factor (ECF) databases on the accuracy of EC calculation from cradle to gate, very little is known about the impact of different databases on the end-of-life (EoL) EC calculation. Using ECFs derived from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) default values and the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE) suggested percentages for different elements of a building’s lifecycle stages, this study presents the impact of different data sources on the calculation of EoL EC. The study revealed that a lack of EoL ECFs databases could result in a significant difference of about 61% and 141% in the calculation of EC.

T1  - Case Study of Using the Geothermal Potential of Mine Water for Central District Heating—The Rožná Deposit, Czech Republic
AN  - 2633183702
AB  - This paper analyzes the possibility of using the thermal energy of discharged environmentally friendly mine water for the heat supply of a selected locality. There are few cases of industrial use of geothermal water in the Czech Republic, but mine water has never been the source. Based on this fact, an analysis of the usability of mine water at the Rožná I Mine was carried out. The analysis showed that the energy output of this pumped water was sufficient for the selected location of the municipality of Dolní Rožínka, where long-term annual average consumptions are at a level of 4350 GJ. The theoretical maximum output of this source is calculated as 837.4 kW; therefore, it exceeds the output required to satisfy the energy needs of this location several times over. Based on this input information, a technical and economic model of the heating system installation project was developed with three options. The case study aimed to find and propose an optimal alternative solution to replace the current unsatisfactory state of heat supply in the village of Dolní Rožínka. In the final part of this paper, the most optimal option is identified by a comparative method, which replaces the existing central district heating based on the production of heat energy from natural gas, i.e., fossil fuels. This study was motivated by a strategy to replace fossil energy sources with renewable energy sources wherever conditions are suitable.

T1  - The Application of the Environment Act 2021 Principles to Carbon Capture and Storage
AN  - 2633069733
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a new technology considered to have the potential to decarbonise economies. However, nationally and internationally the use of CCS has also been raising concerns about its potential global risks and adverse impacts on the environment. CCS was part of the discussions at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in March 2019 and in side-events in the 26th UN Climate Change Conference that took place in Glasgow in November 2021. The UK Government aims to deploy CCS at scale during the 2030s, subject to cost reduction. At the same time, the UK Government has recently enacted the Environment Act 2021, which provides a set of five environmental principles: the integration principle, the principle of preventative action, the precautionary principle, the rectification at source principle and the polluter pays principle. This work seeks to analyse the application of the UK environmental law principles to carbon capture and storage policies in the United Kingdom and its balance with other considerations. Given the concerns surrounding the use of CCS, the debate about its legality may arise in the United Kingdom and in other countries. To this end, this paper initially carries out a systematic review of CCS policy documents to discover the policy considerations that support the development of CCS. It then examines the application of the UK environmental law principles to CCS initiatives and its balance with other considerations, such as reduction of carbon emissions, security of energy supply, economic growth and technological leadership. In doing so, this paper aims at contributing to the debate surrounding recent technological developments that have been utilised to help address climate change and some of the legal challenges emerging through the use of CCS under UK environmental law.

T1  - Dynamic Landscapes in the UK Driven by Pressures from Energy Production and Forestry—Results of the CORINE Land Cover Map 2018
AN  - 2632957086
AB  - The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map was established in 1985 and is now one of the most widely used products from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. As the world’s longest consistent operational land cover monitoring product, CLC maps have been produced for reference years 1990, 2000, 2006, 2012 and now for 2018. This paper presents the results from the CLC2018 mapping project in the UK and analyses the results of the land cover status layer and the change layer from the period 2012–2018. It sets this change in context with the change results from the period 2006–2012 and finds that the rate of change between the subsequent CORINE land cover maps is continuing to increase. Changes mapped for the period 2012–2018 covered 76,032 ha greater than the change mapped between 2006 and 2012, an increase of 26% of mapped change. The area of changes mapped covered an area equivalent to 1.16% of the total land area of the UK. The number of different types of changes also continue to diversify; however, the dominance of rotational forestry is consistent with the previous map. The process of urban land take has been highlighted in the results between 2012 and 2018 and is a trend identified in previous iterations of the CLC inventories. The largest gain is in industrial or commercial units (an increase of 14.4%). This growth is mainly attributed to renewable energy infrastructure. As well as the descriptive analysis, the results have been analysed to identify the likely pressures being experienced on the land in the UK. Although the CLC mapping approach is consistent, there have been improvements to the input EO data used to map the changes. For 2018, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 system offered a consistent and reliable image source for the first time. This increased the spatial resolution of the source datasets to 10 m, allowing for more accurate identification of small features and those with fine spatial textures such as suburban, road networks and windfarms. We also look forward to the development of CLC+, the new generation of CORINE land mapping, and the improvements it could make.

T1  - Socio-Economic Benefits in Community Energy Structures
AN  - 2627845372
AB  - In this paper, the authors examine how a community energy group in the Meadows area of Nottingham in the UK adopted a model of local energy generation and storage as a means of combatting climate change, improving energy efficiency, enhancing energy security, and reducing fuel poverty. By prioritising local needs and managing expectations, this approach was seen to unite community members in acting on energy challenges while increasing knowledge, understanding, and awareness of energy issues in general. The results of the survey indicated that the respondents had a significantly high level of climate awareness (94%) and support for community energy (90%). Furthermore, evidence of the impacts and efficiencies of community energy and subsequent socio-economic benefits were identified, including 89% of respondents reporting a reduction in energy costs and 67% of respondents increasing their self-consumption. Importantly, the barriers experienced when trying to maximise the identified socio-economic benefits are highlighted and general recommendations given.

T1  - It Is a Balancing Act: The Interface of Scientific Evidence and Policy in Support of Effective Marine Environmental Management
AN  - 2627843047
AB  - The marine environment is a complex system, and with growing human demand, the sustainable use of multiple marine resources is continually challenged. The increasing complexity of overlapping marine activities causes pressures on the environment. Here, we review the fundamental aspects for effective marine management, particularly the role of science and scientific evidence to inform marine policy and decision making. The outcomes of internal expert workshops were used to analyse currently applied marine management practices in the UK using four marine sectors in English waters based on the expertise: environmental impact assessments; dredge and disposal operations; marine protected areas; and offshore renewable energy. Strengths, weaknesses, and commonalities between these sectors were assessed in terms of their effectiveness for marine management. Finally, we make recommendations based on the outputs to better inform effective yet sustainable marine management. The importance of increasing accessibility to data, hypothesis-driven environmental monitoring, streamlining funding opportunities and ensuring effective dissemination of data to ensure scientific outcomes and achieve increased robustness of assessments is emphasised. We also recommend that assessment drivers align with the outputs and approaches should be holistic and engage with the public to ensure a shared understanding and vision.

T1  - Assessing and Monitoring of Building Performance by Diverse Methods
AN  - 2627838900
AB  - Buildings are one of the largest contributors to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the world. There is an increased interest in building performance evaluation as an essential practice to design a sustainable building. Building performance is influenced by various terms, for example, designs, construction-related factors such as building envelope and airtightness, and energy technologies with or without micro-generations. How well a building performs thermally is key to determining the level of energy demand and GHG emissions. Building standards and regulations, in combination with assessments (e.g., energy modeling tools) and certifications, provide sets of supports, guidelines and instructions for designers and building engineers to ensure users’ health and well-being, consistency in construction practices and environmental protection. This paper reviews, evaluates and suggests a sequence of building performance methods from the UK perspective. It shows the relationships between such methods, their evolutions and related tools, and further highlights the importance of post-occupancy analysis and how crucial such assessments could be for efficient buildings.

T1  - Electric Vehicles: V2G for Rapid, Safe, and Green EV Penetration
AN  - 2627547048
AB  - Low carbon and renewable energy sources (RESs) are fast becoming a key sustainable instrument in meeting the global growth of electricity demand while curbing carbon emissions. For example, the gradual displacement of fossil-fuelled vehicles with electrically driven counterparts will inevitably increase both the power grid baseload and peak demand. In many developed countries, the electrification process of the transport sector has already started in tandem with the installation of multi-GW renewable energy capacity, particularly wind and solar, huge investment in power storage technology, and end-user energy demand management. The expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market presents a new opportunity to create a cleaner and transformative new energy carrier. For instance, a managed EV battery charging and discharging profile in conjunction with the national grid, known as the Vehicle-to-Grid system (V2G), is projected to be an important mechanism in reducing the impact of renewable energy intermittency. This paper presents an extensive literature review of the current status of EVs and allied interface technology with the power grid. The main findings and statistical details are drawn from up-to-date publications highlighting the latest technological advancements, limitations, and potential future market development. The authors believe that electric vehicle technology will bring huge technological innovation to the energy market where the vehicle will serve both as a means of transport and a dynamic energy vector interfacing with the grid (V2G), buildings (V2B), and others (V2X).

T1  - Universal Digital Twin: Land use
AN  - 2627027225
AB  - This article develops an ontological description of land use and applies it to incorporate geospatial information describing land coverage into a knowledge-graph-based Universal Digital Twin. Sources of data relating to land use in the UK have been surveyed. The Crop Map of England (CROME) is produced annually by the UK Government and was identified as a valuable source of open data. Formal ontologies to represent land use and the geospatial data arising from such surveys have been developed. The ontologies have been deployed using a high-performance graph database. A customized vocabulary was developed to extend the geospatial capabilities of the graph database to support the CROME data. The integration of the CROME data into the Universal Digital Twin is demonstrated in two use cases that show the potential of the Universal Digital Twin to share data across sectors. The first use case combines data about land use with a geospatial analysis of scenarios for energy provision. The second illustrates how the Universal Digital Twin could use the land use data to support the cross-domain analysis of flood risk. Opportunities for the extension and enrichment of the ontologies, and further development of the Universal Digital Twin are discussed.

T1  - Βio-Based Epoxy/Amine Reinforced with Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) or GLYMO-rGO: Study of Curing Kinetics, Mechanical Properties, Lamination and Bonding Performance
AN  - 2621350572
AB  - In this work, we report the synthesis and study of nanocomposites with a biobased epoxy/amine (Epilok 60-600G/Curamine 30-952) matrix reinforced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or functionalised with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO-rGO). These graphene related materials (GRMs) were first dispersed into a Curamine hardener using bath ultrasonication, followed by the addition of epoxy resin. Curing kinetics were studied by DSC under non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. The addition of 1.5 wt% of GLYMO-rGO into the epoxy matrix was found to increase the degree of cure by up to 12% and glass transition temperature by 14 °C. Mechanical testing showed that the addition of 0.05 wt% GLYMO-rGO improves Young’s modulus and tensile strength by 60% and 16%, respectively, compared to neat epoxy. Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates were prepared via hand lay up, using the nanocomposite system GRM/Epilok/Curamine as matrix, and were cut as CFRP adherents for lap shear joints. GRM/Epilok/Curamine was also used as adhesive to bond CFRP/CFRP and CFRP/aluminium adherents. The addition of 0.1 wt% GLYMO-rGO into the adhesive and CRFP adherents showed improved lap shear strength by 23.6% compared to neat resin, while in the case of CFRP/Aluminium joints the increase was 21.2%.

T1  - An Exploration of Environmentally Sustainable Practices Associated with Alternative Grazing Management System Use for Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and Mules in the UK
AN  - 2621242377
AB  - Simple SummaryEquestrian land could be a potentially important environmental resource, given that pastureland can help to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, prevent soil erosion and provide diverse ecosystems for native plant and wildlife species. However, equestrian land has been overlooked in environmental research and policy. This study reports on the ways which horse, pony, donkey and mule keepers in the UK described environmental practices as part of their equid care. Through an analysis of survey responses (N = 758) from equid keepers using alternative grazing systems, we report on three very different management approaches which resulted in keepers aiming to promote healthy pastures and healthy animals. This study provides the basis for future research exploring attitudes to sustainability in equid keepers, as well as evaluating the impact of their efforts.AbstractEquestrian grazing management is a poorly researched area, despite potentially significant environmental impacts. This study explored keepers’ use of alternative grazing systems in the care of UK horses, donkeys and mules through an internet survey. The survey was available during the summer of 2020 and comprised closed and open questions, which were analysed with descriptive statistics and iterative thematic analysis, respectively. A total of 758 responses was incorporated into the analysis; the most popular system used were tracks (56.5%), Equicentral (19%), “other” (e.g., non-grass turnout) (12.5%), rewilding (7.5%) and turnout on either moorland (0.7%) or woodland (2.5%). The thematic analysis highlighted that equid keepers across the systems were highly engaged in exploring sustainable practices. Their approaches varied according to each system, yet all aimed to fulfil practices in three major categories, i.e., supporting diverse plant life (usually through restricting equid access to certain areas), supporting wildlife (through the creation of biodiverse environments) and sustainably managing droppings and helminths. Additionally, proponents of the Equicentral systems declared to be aiming to support soil health. These data provide a promising insight into equid keepers’ behaviour and attitudes to sustainability.

T1  - Planning Adaptation: Accommodating Complexity in the Built Environment
AN  - 2619551970
AB  - :  Obsolescence and vacancy are part of the traditional building life cycle, as tenants leave properties and move to new ones. Flux, a period of uncertainty before the establishment of new direction, can be considered part of building DNA. What is new, due to structural disruptions in the way we work, is the rate and regularity of flux, reflected in obsolescence, vacancy, and impermanent use. Covid-19 has instantly accelerated this disruption. Retail failure has increased with even more consumers moving online. While employees have been working from home, rendering the traditional office building in the central business district, at least temporarily, obsolete. This article reflects on the situation by reporting findings from an 18-month research project into the practice of planning adaptation in the English built environment. Original findings based on interviews with a national sample of local authority planners, combined with an institutional analysis of planning practice since the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, suggest that the discipline of planning in England is struggling with the reality of flux. There is a demand for planning to act faster, due to the speed of change in the built environment, and liberal political concerns with planning regulation. This is reflected in relaxations to permitted development rules and building use categories. However, participants also indicate that there is a concurrent need for the planning system to operate in a more measured way, to plan the nuanced complexity of a built environment no longer striated by singular use categories at the local level. This notion of flux suggests a process of perpetual change, turbulence, and volatility. However, our findings suggest that within this process, there is a temporal dialectic between an accelerating rate of change in the built environment and a concomitant need to plan in a careful way to accommodate adaptation. We situate these findings in a novel reading of the complex adaptive systems literature, arguing that planning practice needs to embrace uncertainty, rather than eradicate it, in order to enable built environment adaptation. These findings are significant because they offer a framework for understanding how successful building adaptation can be enabled in England, moving beyond the negativity associated with the adaptation of buildings in recent years. This is achieved by recognizing the complex interactions involved in the adaptation process between respective stakeholders and offering an insight into how respective scales of planning governance can coexist successfully.

T1  - Does the Past Affect the Future? An Analysis of Consumers’ Dining Intentions towards Green Restaurants in the UK
AN  - 2618270416
AB  - Due to the growing notion of environmental protection, many restaurants have started to apply operational practices to diminish their carbon footprint, leading to the emergence of “green” restaurants. Green restaurants are establishments committed to minimizing adverse environmental consequences throughout their operations. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to examine consumer behavior in this field. Taking the consumers’ perspective, this study uses an augmented theory of planned behavior (TPB) and a cross-section of 896 British diners to explain their dining intentions towards green restaurants. The extended model of the TPB was tested to justify the addition of past behavior and the impact of sociodemographic characteristics. Using structural equation analysis, the results identified past behavior, perceived behavioral control, subjective descriptive norms, and attitude as critical factors influencing behavioral intention. Furthermore, apart from gender, the relationships between sociodemographics and intentions to dine at green restaurants were insignificant. This research provides insightful implications in the green restaurant domain and suggestions for future research.

T1  - Reducing GHG Emissions and Improving Cost Effectiveness via Energy Efficiency Enhancements: A Case Study in a Biscuit Industry
AN  - 2618269506
AB  - As the new climate change driven regulations are brought into the force and energy prices and sustainability awareness increased, many companies are looking for the most efficient way to reduce their energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this context, the food industry as one of the main energy consumers within the industry sector plays a significant role. This paper analyses the current energy consumption in a biscuit manufacturing company and considers a number of possible solutions for the energy efficiency improvements. The company uses modern and automated production processes and has signed a Climate Change Agreement. The experimental part involves identification of the energy users, as well as analysis of the energy bills, operation times, production schedule and on-site measurements of energy consumption. The opportunities for energy efficiency improvements, GHG emissions and costs reduction are investigated and additional information about the investments and payback period of the proposed improvements discussed. A number of opportunities for improvement are identified within the production area with a potential savings of 23%, which corresponds to EUR 40,534.00 and 190 tCO2, annually. It was found that the significant savings could be achieved by better managing the production lines and reducing operational hours from equipment, with no impact on productivity and no capital investment required. Further savings can be achieved through technical improvements requiring capital investments. All those improvements and savings make a significant contribution in accomplishing environmental targets set out by the FDF1 agreement.

AN  - 2608507140
AB  - The goal of mitigating climate change requires a global commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid substantial temperature increases.

Plants draw CO2 from the atmosphere to grow using photosynthesis.

Since the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations from around 280 parts per million (ref. 2) to 416 parts per million in 2020 (ref. 1).

[...]terrestrial biosphere models rely mostly on empirical approaches to simulate where the carbon absorbed by plants goes.

AB  - The UK Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution aims to ban petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Current business models for EV ownership and the transition to net-net zero emissions are not working for households in the lowest income brackets. However, low-income communities bear the brunt of environmental and health illnesses from transport air pollution caused by those living in relatively more affluent areas. Importantly, achieving equitable EV ownership amongst low-and middle-income households and driving policy goals towards environmental injustice of air pollution and net-zero emissions would require responsible and circular business models. Such consumer-focused business models address an EV subscription via low-income household tax rebates, an EV battery value-chain circularity, locally-driven new battery technological development, including EV manufacturing tax rebates and socially innovative mechanisms. This brief communication emphasises that consumer-led business models following net-zero emission vehicles shift and decisions must ensure positive-sum outcomes. And must focus not only on profits and competitiveness but also on people, planet, prosperity and partnership co-benefits.

T1  - Understanding the barriers to NET-ZERO transport for rural roads: a Northern Ireland case study
AN  - 2729540082
AB  - IntroductionClimate-related disasters have cost the world over £450 billion over the last 3 years. In the race to mitigate these effects, the UK government has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. Transport provides the largest single sector contribution to CO2 emissions, the road network accounts for up to 91%. As the only UK country without a formal climate change bill Northern Ireland could compromise the overall effort.Case descriptionIn this research a survey of road asset owners, managers, academics, consultants, public transport providers was undertaken to seek to understand the current barriers to adapting a dispersed rural road network in Northern Ireland for net-zero transport. The survey data was collected though an online form with a combination of multiple choice and open ended questions. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the data collected which enabled a discussion around the key expert opinions gathered.Discussion and evaluationThe paper presents details of the current road network in Northern Ireland and highlights some of the issues faced by asset owners. The survey questions were developed though engagement with transport professionals in Northern Ireland and focus predominantly on road use rather than the impact of current land management practices or environmental conditions such as flood risk. The response highlights a clear enthusiasm for change in the operation of the public road network which is hindered by a lack of government strategy and limited public consultation.ConclusionsThe high response rate (41%) for the survey highlights the interest of those in the transport sector to engage in activities which can support a better understanding of how road networks contribute to CO2 emissions. Within the survey data a requirement for behavioural change was highlighted as a key step to reduce transport related emissions, the enthusiasm for change demonstrates this is the optimum time to engage with the public and develop clear transport strategies. More accurate findings and empirical evidence could have been established had the study considered specific, transport planning, environmental and land use conditions for Northern Ireland. This will be the focus of further research in this area to enable clear translation of the research to other countries.

TT  - <strong>Globalizing europe</strong>
AN  - 2649535106
AB  - Globaliser l’EuropeCet essai propose une réflexion sur l’étude historique des liens entre l’Europe moderne et contemporaine et le reste du monde. Il explore les manières dont l’histoire européenne peut être intégrée à l’histoire globale, en considérant l’Europe non seulement comme un moteur, mais aussi comme un produit des transformations mondiales. À partir d’un large aperçu historiographique, l’auteur discute de l’influence du « tournant global » sur différents domaines de l’histoire européenne moderne et contemporaine, notamment l’histoire politique, économique, sociale, intellectuelle et environnementale. Il soutient que l’histoire globale représente tant un défi qu’une opportunité considérable pour les européistes d’ouvrir l’histoire européenne moderne. Cette approche nous aidera finalement à remodeler notre compréhension des frontières de l’Europe – et du domaine de l’histoire européenne lui-même. En d’autres termes, cela nous permettra de déprovincialiser l’Europe. De manière plus générale, l’essai aborde également des questions plus larges sur les continents (et d’autres unités spatiales) en tant que catégories ontologiques dans les études historiques.Alternate abstract:This essay offers a reflection on the historical study of modern Europe’s entanglements with the wider world. It explores the ways in which European history can be integrated into global history, considering Europe as not only an engine but also a product of global transformations. Providing a broad historiographical overview, the author discusses the impact of the “global turn” on different fields of modern European history, including political, economic, social, intellectual, and environmental history. He argues that global history represents not only a challenge but also a huge opportunity for Europeanists to open up modern European history. This will ultimately help us reshape our understanding of the boundaries of Europe—and the field of European history itself. In other words, it will allow us to deprovincialize Europe. More generally, the essay also engages with broader questions about continents (and other spatial units) as ontological categories in historical studies.

T1  - COSMOPOLITAN THEORY: EXAMINING THE (DIS-)LOCATION OF IMAGOLOGY
AN  - 2630953722
AB  - Being interdisciplinary, reflexive and analytical, theory has practical effects, questioning assumptions such as those related to discourse, meaning or identity, and exploring the circumstances in which texts are produced. It offers new conceptual tools and provides an argumentative method. Fields such as imagology have benefitted from the outset from the variety of theories reflecting the intellectual progress of their times, in particular in connection with the study of the relationship between Self and Other, thus providing new perspectives on the uses of preconceived ideas in artistic, written and visual, representations. In view of the current context of migratory flows and societal upheavals, it seems topical to examine the theories feeding the field of imagology today. Traditionally, history, psychology and sociology have proved instrumental in the building of essential notions pertaining to the sphere. More recently, studies have drawn on new approaches connected to reception, translation, gender and education studies, widening the imagological scope and its range of methodological tools. This article examines the nature of the imagological undertaking, its current spread worldwide, and shows how this comparative literary field upholds a cosmopolitan ethos.

T1  - The Case of the United Kingdom: Mapping Localism, Resilience, and Civic Activism in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2615608460
AB  - This article explores the determinants of local resilience in the form of local COVID-19 mutual aid groups. These groups were formed to offer mutual help to those who had experienced a loss of social quality. We test a series of hypotheses, considering which conditional factors are most connected to the formation of these groups, particularly focusing on those that influenced the earliest and most resilient local response to the pandemic. The presence of radical environmentalist activists is a better predictor of resilient community responsiveness than either the activity of the local state or the activity of more moderate community-based environmental civil society organizations. Conclusions are presented on the implications of these findings for the future of localism, social quality, and public policy in the United Kingdom.

T1  - Report of the 2nd Annual General Meeting of ENETWILD 5-6th October 2021
AN  - 2615089601
AB  - The 2nd ENETWILD Annual General Meeting took place on 5-6th October 2021, bringing together experts, stakeholders and ENETWILD collaborators in online workshop discussions. First, workshop discussions contributed to the analysis and proposal of approaches for a harmonized European-wide wildlife monitoring framework able of sustaining coordinated decision-making. Secondly, participants identified the key challenges that managers face in making decisions for wildlife in Europe and data needs for policies. Finally, we illustrated these challenges with the case of wild boar as a model species widely distributed across Europe. Inputs from the participants were collated into a plan of proposed steps and objectives for the mid-term (5-year time frame) to achieve progress on harmonised, coordinated, and integrated wildlife monitoring at the European level, which requires the contribution of experts from the early stages.. Specific proposed actions include the creation of a trans-disciplinary authority at the European level, effective points of reference for data collection and sharing at different administrative levels and countries, a standing committee to coordinate and exchange experience and capacities on data collection between countries, and expert groups for problem solving, with proper EU financial support, establishing regular policy meetings. . To provide useful results, wildlife monitoring must ensure proper design and data analysis for subsequent science-based management and best allocation of management resources. The 'Observatory' approach (a representative network of intensively monitored sites) can provide long-term systematic and representative insights, normally more feasible for comparative studies, providing less biases and support for decision-making. For international decision-making by wildlife managers and politicians based on scientific knowledge and interdisciplinary research, experts should define the foundations of a common European wildlife decision-making framework (inter-institutional and inter-sectorial). The development of a European legislation on wildlife management may represent an opportunity for addressing the abovementioned steps, identifying data priorities matching the needs of the various European Directorates, Agencies, and monitoring frameworks.

T1  - COP26 CLIMATE SUMMIT: A SCIENTISTS' GUIDE TO A MOMENTOUS MEETING
AN  - 2594204588
AB  - Climate researchers have been warning about the dire and increasing impacts of global warming for more than three decades, and for some, the meeting, which began on 31 October, represents one final opportunity for the governments of the world to craft a collective plan to meet their most ambitious goals for curbing climate change.

Throughout this two-week event, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), government officials and business leaders are presenting their latest commitments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and scientists are discussing efforts to track emissions, understand impacts and advance potential climate solutions.

Six years later, COP26 represents the first major test of the Paris agreement, which committed countries to holding global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and - at the insistence of small island states and developing nations existentially threatened by rising seas and other climate impacts - "pursuing efforts" to prevent more than 1.5 °C of warming.

Scientists have linked Indigenous land rights with biodiversity conservation and reduced deforestation - and thus carbon emissions - in the Amazon rainforest and across the tropics.

T1  - Potential alien ranges of European plants will shrink in the future, but less so for already naturalized than for not yet naturalized species
AN  - 2636811487; IND607547707
AB  - AIMS: The rapid increase in the number of species that have naturalized beyond their native range is among the most apparent features of the Anthropocene. How alien species will respond to other processes of future global changes is an emerging concern and remains poorly misunderstood. We therefore ask whether naturalized species will respond to climate and land use change differently than those species not yet naturalized anywhere in the world. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We investigated future changes in the potential alien range of vascular plant species endemic to Europe that are either naturalized (n = 272) or not yet naturalized (1,213) outside of Europe. Potential ranges were estimated based on projections of species distribution models using 20 future climate‐change scenarios. We mapped current and future global centres of naturalization risk. We also analysed expected changes in latitudinal, elevational and areal extent of species’ potential alien ranges. RESULTS: We showed a large potential for more worldwide naturalizations of European plants currently and in the future. The centres of naturalization risk for naturalized and non‐naturalized plants largely overlapped, and their location did not change much under projected future climates. Nevertheless, naturalized plants had their potential range shifting poleward over larger distances, whereas the non‐naturalized ones had their potential elevational ranges shifting further upslope under the most severe climate change scenarios. As a result, climate and land use changes are predicted to shrink the potential alien range of European plants, but less so for already naturalized than for non‐naturalized species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: While currently non‐naturalized plants originate frequently from mountain ranges or boreal and Mediterranean biomes in Europe, the naturalized ones usually occur at low elevations, close to human centres of activities. As the latter are expected to increase worldwide, this could explain why the potential alien range of already naturalized plants will shrink less.

T1  - Theory and politics in organization
AN  - 2623047212
AB  - Iain Munro, then a lecturer in operations management and now Professor of Leadership and Organisational Change at Newcastle Business School, was a part of this group, and stood out as an awe-inspiring, progressive presence at Warwick in those days.

There are four key aspects we think are important to understand, both for the sake of historical understanding and for the theory and politics of organization today: first, the intellectual context from which ephemera was established and took root; second, the importance of institutions that provided the medium and nutrients for the journal's early fermentation; third, the political-economic context of universities, and specifically business schools, in the UK at the turn of the millennium, as well as their sometimes parasitic symbiote, the publishing industry; and fourth, the very idea of organization, as verb and noun, which ephemera has always intended to displace and disorganize, in the hope to reach the shores of a radical new organization of life.

Pandemonium offered a radical opening of organization theory to its constitutive yet endlessly silenced outside, its repressed others, and opened to a creative practice of reading and writing that not only tweaked the nose but punched the face of the positivist reactionaries holed up in the business school.

The first issues of ephemera were printed and bound in paper at the University's print services, with funding that had been provided by Warwick Business School.

T1  - The decolonizing future of organization studies
AN  - 2623044691
AB  - In this paper, we propose that organizational studies researchers must pay attention to the contributions of decolonial epistemology, which has been developing counterhegemonic, marginal, and subaltern organizational theories, embedded in the radicality of broken silence. The decolonizing future of research in organization studies opens up possibilities for new organizational modes of existence - from the perspective of indigenous societies and different knowledge from that of modernity. We explore main concepts related to the decolonizing movement, seeking to elucidate its main ideas and transposing them to organizational studies. We have found four main heterarchical reinterpretations provided by decolonial scholars on the field of organization studies: (a) the organization concept, (b) the history of economic development in colonized nations and management organizational knowledge, (c) consumption, technology and changes in the natural environment and (d) intersectional studies about gender, race, and social class. It is possible to anticipate that the future of organization studies may be marked either by segregation, or heterarchical thinking integration within a global agenda. The first scenario is featured by the flourishing of alternative thinking outside academia environments and valuing the great diversity of languages worldwide; the second scenario must be featured by the openness to provide a more organic and structured presence for groups of emerging countries in international science arenas. We stand that the heterarchical thinking can contribute to overcoming an increasingly polarized world, allowing the rise of several knowledge production competing arenas of, making possible a more democratic development for organizational studies.

T1  - Mitigating the impact of climate change on UK buildings through zero energy strategies
AN  - 2597842222
AB  - It is currently established that one of the paramount concerns in the built environment is the energy efficiency of new and existing UK dwellings, respective to the unfavourable impacts posed to climate change. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the United Kingdom have reported that the UK’s highest recording temperatures have transpired in the years since 2002. With over 90% of England homes currently in use of high carbon systems for space heating and domestic hot water. Contributing to increased atmospheric carbon emissions in the dependency on fossil fuel burning; alluding to human-produced atmospheric temperature increase. To help tackle these issues in the residential sector, the capacity of zero-energy technologies has been introduced. Zero-energy implementation has potential to revolutionise the power system, with on-site power generation at the forefront of this. This paper will explore the influence of zero-energy implementation on two UK residential dwellings of disparate locations, using Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IESVE) by focusing on renewable on-site micro-generation systems. The ASHRAE climate zones of Edinburgh and London Gatwick has been selected to examine the performance of the building over varied regional climates of disparate locations. The selected design variables were finally implemented in combination for building simulation in IESVE and compared with a basic model dwelling. The processed simulation results showed a reduction in the buildings energy consumption of 43.4538MWh (71%) for Edinburgh and 33.9929MWh (64%) for London respective to the baseline model. The greatest savings in mitigation of UK climate change can be evaluated in relation to reduction of carbon emissions, which were 7880kgCO2 (46%) and 5423kgCO2 (36%) respectively.

T1  - A social norms approach intervention to address misperceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs amongst UK parents
AN  - 2596927135
AB  - Anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among parents can reduce vaccination intentions. Parents’ beliefs in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories are also related to their perceptions of other parents’ conspiracy beliefs. Further, research has shown that parents hold misperceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy belief norms: UK parents over-estimate the anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs of other parents. The present study tested the effectiveness of a Social Norms Approach intervention, which corrects misperceptions using normative feedback, to reduce UK parents’ anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and increase vaccination intentions. At baseline, 202 UK parents of young children reported their personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, future intentions to vaccinate, and their perceptions of other UK parents’ beliefs and intentions. Participants were then randomly assigned to a normative feedback condition (n = 89) or an assessment-only control condition (n = 113). The normative feedback compared participants’ personal anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and perceptions of other UK parents’ beliefs with actual normative belief levels. Parents receiving the normative feedback showed significantly reduced personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs at immediate post-test. As hypothesised, changes in normative perceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs mediated the effect of the intervention. The intervention, did not directly increase vaccination intentions, however mediation analysis showed that the normative feedback increased perceptions of other parents’ vaccination intentions, which in turn increased personal vaccination intentions. No significant effects remained after a six-week follow-up. The current research demonstrates the potential utility of Social Norms Approach interventions for correcting misperceptions and reducing anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among UK parents. Further research could explore utilising a top-up intervention to maintain the efficacy.

T1  - The potential contribution of terrestrial nature‐based solutions to a national ‘net zero’ climate target
AN  - 2596237634
AB  - Many national governments have incorporated nature‐based solutions (NbS) in their plans to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties persist regarding both feasibility and consequences of major NbS deployment. Using the United Kingdom as a national‐level case study, we examined the potential contribution of three terrestrial NbS: peatland restoration, saltmarsh creation and woodland creation.While there is substantial political and societal interest in these three NbS, they also have strong potential for competition with other land uses, which will be a critical barrier to substantial deployment. We conducted a national mapping exercise to assess the potential area available for woodland creation. We then assessed the combined climate change mitigation potential to 2100 for the three NbS options under a range of ambition levels.In line with the most ambitious targets examined, 2 Mha of land is potentially available for new woodland. However, climate change mitigation benefits of woodland are strongly dependent on management choices. By 2100, scenarios with a greater proportion of broadleaved woodlands outsequester non‐native conifer plantations, which are limited by regular timber harvesting.Peatland restoration offers the greatest mitigation per unit area, whilst the contribution from saltmarsh creation is limited by the small areas involved. Overall, the contribution of these NbS to the United Kingdom’s net zero emissions target is relatively modest. Even with the most ambitious targets considered here, by 2100, the total cumulative mitigation from the three NbS is equivalent to only 3 years' worth of UK emissions at current levels.Policy implications. Major deployment of nature‐based solutions (NbS) is possible in the United Kingdom but reaching ‘net zero’ primarily requires substantial and sustained reductions in fossil fuel use. However, facilitating these NbS at the national scale could offer many additional benefits for people and biodiversity. This demands that policy‐makers commit to a UK‐wide strategic approach that prioritises the ‘nature’ aspect of NbS. In the push to reach ‘net zero’, climate change mitigation should not be used to justify land management practices that threaten biodiversity ambitions.

T1  - Conceptualizing the techno-environmental habitus
AN  - 2594713409
AB  - This paper conceptualizes the techno-environmental habitus to explore differentiation among media users and their climate change awareness by adopting a dynamic concept that takes into consideration both pre-existing conditions and interactions with the technological field of action. The paper investigates the characteristics of multi-layered dispositions towards climate change in the U.K. through an online survey of a representative sample of the U.K. population (N=1,013). Results show that, despite the predominance of advocacy positions, four different techno-environmental habitus point to a fragmented landscape, but also a “chameleon”, transformative capacity of habitus, given that some common traits are shared by the groups. Beyond the four different patterns related to techno-environmental attitudes, one of the most interesting findings relates to the fatalistic techno-environmental habitus, which presents some traits in common with the scepticism and advocacy approaches but tends to be discouraged with regard to taking action. The identification of the nuances of techno-environmental habitus is relevant for climate change policy implementation because they may facilitate or hinder both individual and collective action.

T1  - Recent decreases in domestic energy consumption in the United Kingdom attributed to human influence on the climate
AN  - 2590731013
AB  - Domestic energy consumption in the United Kingdom depends on both meteorological and socio‐economic factors. The former are dominated by the effect of temperature during the colder months of the year, with the energy demand increasing as the temperature decreases. Warming of the UK climate under the influence of anthropogenic forcings is therefore expected to lead to a reduction in domestic energy consumption. Here, we present an end‐to‐end attribution study that investigates whether the anthropogenic effect on consumption is already evident in the United Kingdom. We analyse data of gas and electricity use in UK households during 2008–2019 and use a simple linear model to express the temperature dependence. Uncertainties in the resulting transfer functions are derived with a recent methodology, originally introduced for downscaling purposes, but adapted here for use in impact studies. The transfer functions are applied to temperature data from simulations with and without the effect of human influence on the climate, generated by 11 state‐of‐the‐art climate models. We thus assess the anthropogenic impact on energy consumption during the reference period by comparing it with what it might have been in a climate without anthropogenic climate change, but at the same level of adaptation. We find that without human influence on the climate, UK households would consume on average about 1,400 kWh more per year, which would increase the annual energy bills by about 70 GBP. Our attribution assessment provides useful evidence of an impact that has already emerged, which can help inform UK's adaptation plans as the climate continues to warm.

T1  - Histories of Everyday Life:&nbsp;The Making of Popular Social History in Britain, 1918-1979
T2  - The Past and Present Book Series
AN  - 2554616162
AB  - Histories of Everyday Life is a study of the production and consumption of popular social history in mid-twentieth century Britain. It explores how non-academic historians, many of them women, developed a new breed of social history after the First World War, identified as the 'history of everyday life'. The 'history of everyday life' was a pedagogical construct based on the perceived educational needs of the new, mass democracy that emerged after 1918. Itwas popularized to ordinary people in educational settings, through books, in classrooms and museums, and on BBC radio. After tracing its development and dissemination between the 1920s and the 1960s, this book argues that 'history of everyday life' declined in the 1970s not because academics invented analternative 'new' social history, but because bottom-up social change rendered this form of popular social history untenable in the changing context of mass education. Histories of Everyday Life ultimately uses the subject of history to demonstrate how profoundly the advent of mass education shaped popular culture in Britain after 1918, arguing that we should see the twentieth century as Britain's educational century.

T1  - Thermal upgrades in traditional buildings – a multi factored approach
AN  - 2585952846
AB  - Balancing the needs of building conservation and carbon reduction, whilst often considered a challenge, it can also be an opportunity. This paper will start by outlining some refurbishment principles that have been followed by Historic Environment Scotland in a conservation-based approach to the refurbishment of traditional buildings. The principles develop themes in building conservation and retrofit discussed by Historic Environment Scotland and other heritage organisations and add in more recent thinking on resources, embodied carbon, the circular economy and climate change to give what might be called a ‘multifactored approach’. These factors or considerations are not new in heritage work but are not often considered in mainstream, less conservation focussed refurbishment projects. These factors go beyond issues of heritage conservation alone and allow the experience and findings of conservation sector to be part of a wider sustainability movement in the built environment, where the retrofit of existing older buildings of all types, protected or otherwise, are seen as part of the solution, not the problem. By adopting a conservation approach in all buildings more carbon can be saved, and more buildings retrofitted appropriately.

T1  - Representation of climate change consequences in British newspapers
AN  - 2579551932
AB  - This article explores British newspaper descriptions of the impact of climate change across three time periods. It shows a reduction in representing the consequences of climate change as ‘out of human control’. It also shows a decrease in adopting alarming and uncertain descriptions within the centre-left group, whereas mocking the effects of climate change is a peculiarity of right-leaning narratives. The complexity of climate narratives produces a variety of representations of the consequences of climate change, which in turn might increase ‘uncertainty’ in public understanding of climate change.

T1  - 1299 Carbon literacy training in healthcare professionals: a survey of paediatricians
AN  - 2578037439
AB  - BackgroundThe NHS is responsible for 5% of the UK’s carbon footprint. Every professional within the NHS has a duty to commit to reducing their department’s carbon emissions to meet the government’s net zero pledge by 2040.As Paediatricians and advocates of children, young people and future generations, it is our responsibility to take an active role in tackling the climate emergency. The first step is education and carbon literacy of our current workforce. Carbon Literacy’ is defined the awareness of climate change and the climate impacts of mankind’s everyday actions.In October 2020, The RCPCH joined a growing coalition of public health and medical organisations in declaring a climate emergency. This involved the convening of a Climate Change Working Group with workstreams including, investment policy, greening the workplace, research and curriculum changes.As Paediatricians, educators, leaders and mentors, we have a major role in influencing trusts to implement Green Plans and carbon reduction strategies. Through education of health care professionals and ensuring that sustainability is at the heart of every quality improvement activity we can work with governments towards the net zero pledge.ObjectivesInvestigate current views on the importance of the NHS’s role in the climate crisis within health professionals.To assess prevalence of previous carbon literacy training, awareness and motivation to participate in further training.MethodsThe author developed a survey of 9 questions enquiring about previous carbon literacy training, quality improvement projects involving sustainability and perceived importance of the climate crisis within the NHS. The survey was distributed by SurveyMonkey to all Paediatric Doctors in the Mersey Deanery training group and those working on Paediatric Intensive Care. The survey was anonymous and open between February and March 2021 and there was no financial incentive to participate.Results38 healthcare professionals responded over a 1-month period. They were all Doctors and all except 1 were Paediatricians (Trainees, Consultants and Staff Grades). Respondents’ graduation dates ranged from 1987 to 2016 and they reported attending Medical Schools both in the UK and Internationally. Only 2 (5%) of the participants reported formal Carbon Literacy training, while 80% (30) reported that they would not know how to calculate the carbon footprint of their personal or departmental activities. 95% (36) said they would be interested in knowing more about how to reduce the carbon footprint of the NHS.ConclusionsThis survey highlights that health professionals are very interested and invested in the climate emergency but the majority of them have not many have had formal carbon literacy training. By incorporating sustainability teaching into the curriculum, Paediatricians and those working in our specialty will feel more empowered to make changes to their quality improvement projects, lobby trusts and work together in driving down the carbon footprint of our departments and those of the future. This survey is an opportunity to engage interested professionals and will be extended to other health professionals in our region. It will act as a guide to curriculum change and educational interventions on climate change.

T1  - Environmental and Geomorphological Effects on the Distribution of Deep-Sea Canyon and Seamount Communities in the Northwest Atlantic
AN  - 2574547991
AB  - Deep sea canyons and seamounts are topographically complex features that are considered to be biological hotspots. Anthropogenic pressures related to climate change and human activities are placing the species that inhabit these features at risk. Though studies have examined species composition on seamounts and canyons, few have compared communities between them, and even fewer studies have examined how species’ abundances correlate with environmental conditions or geomorphology. Consequently, this study compares species composition, community structure, and environmental variables between Northwest Atlantic continental margin canyons and seamounts along the New England Seamount Chain. Geomorphic settings were also related to the occurrence of phyla and biodiversity. Overall, there was a significant difference in species composition between canyons and seamounts with sponges, corals, sea urchins and seastars contributing heavily to observed differences. Environmental conditions of temperature and salinity and the seafloor property substrate contributed significantly to communities observed on seamounts, while substrate, depth and salinity contributed significantly to canyon communities. Abundances were significantly higher in canyons, but taxonomic richness, evenness, and diversity were all greater on seamounts. In an era where climate change and human activity have the potential to alter environmental parameters in the deep sea, it is important to examine factors that influence the spatial distribution of deep-sea benthic communities.

T1  - James Croll – bicentenary and biography, from janitor to genius
AN  - 2620907168
AB  - How did a man who grew up on a croft in Scotland, with little schooling, reach the pinnacle of 19th century scientific achievement as a climate change pioneer, become a correspondent of Darwin amongst others, and then almost disappear from general awareness?

Seven years later and a janitor in Glasgow, his article ‘On the physical cause of the change of climate during geological epochs’ (Croll 1864) came to be recognised widely as a landmark contribution to an understanding of climate change.

Croll was the first to consider the effect of positive feedback, which increased the effect of orbital variation of insolation and transformed that variation into global climate change, that is into glaciations and interglacial periods.

The institution provided Croll with a magnificent scientific library and a paper on electromagnetism (Croll 1861) represented his first foray into conventional science, soon followed by contributions on such topics as chemistry, heat, tidal waves, the Earth's rotation and lunar motion, climate change and glaciology.

T1  - Cosmic connections: James Croll's influence on his contemporaries and his successors
AN  - 2620907070
AB  - This paper examines the astronomical theory of ice ages of James Croll (1821–1890), its influence on contemporaries John Tyndall, Charles Lyell, and Charles Darwin, and the subsequent development of climate change science, giving special attention to the work of Svante Arrhenius, Nils Ekholm, and G. S. Callendar (for the carbon dioxide theory), and Milutin Milanković (for the astronomical theory). Croll's insight that the orbital elements triggered feedbacks leading to complex changes – in seasonality, ocean currents, ice sheets, radiative forcing, plant and animal life, and climate in general – placed his theory of the Glacial Epoch at the nexus of astronomy, terrestrial physics, and geology. He referred to climate change as the most important problem in terrestrial physics, and the one which will ultimately prove the most far reaching in its consequences. He was an autodidact deeply involved in philosophy and an early proponent of what came to be called ‘cosmic physics’ – later known as ‘Earth-system science.’ Croll opened up new dimensions of the ‘climate controversy’ that continue today in the interplay of geological and human influences on climate.

T1  - James Croll and 1876: an exceptional year for a ‘singularly modest man’
AN  - 2620907041
AB  - James Croll left school at the age of 13 years, yet while a janitor in Glasgow he published a landmark paper on astronomically-related climate change, claimed as ‘the most important discovery in paleoclimatology’, and which brought him to the attention of Charles Darwin, William Thomson and John Tyndall, amongst others. By 1867 he was persuaded to become Secretary and Accountant of the newly established Geological Survey of Scotland in Edinburgh, and a year after the appearance of his keynote volume Climate and time in 1875, he was lauded with an honorary doctorate from Scotland's oldest university, Fellowship of the Royal Society of London and Honorary Membership of the New York Academy of Sciences. Using a range of archival and published sources, this paper explores aspects of his ‘journey’ and the background to the award of these major accolades. It also discusses why he never became a Fellow of his national academy, the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In the world of 19th-Century science, Croll was not unusual in being both an autodidact and of humble origins, nor was he lacking in support for his endeavours. It is possible that a combination of Croll's modesty and innovative genius fostered advancement, though this did not hinder a willingness to engage in vigorous argument.

T1  - James Croll – a man ‘greater far than his work’
AN  - 2620906953
AB  - Popular and scholarly information concerning the life of James Croll has been accumulating slowly since the death in 1890 of the self-taught climate change pioneer. The papers in the current volume offer thorough assessments of topics associated with Croll's work, but this contribution seeks to provide a personal context for an understanding of James Croll the man, as well as James Croll the scholar of sciences and religion. Using archival as well as published sources, emphasis is placed upon selected components of his life and some of the less recognised features of his biography. These include his family history, his many homes, his health, participation in learned societies and attitudes to collegiality, financial problems including the failed efforts to secure a larger pension, and friendship. Life delivered a mixture of ‘trials and sorrows’, but it seems clear from the affection and respect accorded him that many looked upon James Croll as a ‘man greater far than his work’.

T1  - Croll, feedback mechanisms, climate change and the future
AN  - 2620906337
AB  - Our climate future depends on the delicate, fine balance of earth processes first elaborated on by James Croll, born 200 years ago in 1821. A childhood victim of the Scottish clearances, Croll, after following various indifferent occupations, managed to remove to the then rapidly industrialising city of Glasgow and eventually to Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. He blossomed as a most original, outside-the-box, thinker of great intellectual strength and modesty. He carried out scores of studies across a broad range of research topics, many related to the physical causes of climate change. He is well known for his astronomical theory of the ice ages, but should be much better regarded for his incisive physical insights into the central importance of feedbacks in the Earth system. Although humble, Croll was an ardent controversialist who strongly, perhaps over-strongly, always defended his corner. As well as his many accomplishments as a man of science, Croll was committed to exploring philosophical questions of theism and determinism, topics which occupied his earliest and last publications. A ‘top ten’ selection out of the varied subject areas that Croll tackled are explored herein, along with a brisk survey of their legacy to contemporary modelling studies and to Earth's climate future: (1) causes of climate change (1864); (2) ice-cap melt and sea-level rise (1865); (3) predicting future climates using eccentricity (1866); (4) combining orbital precession, eccentricity and obliquity (1867); (5) geological time and the date of the glacial epochs (1868); (6) geological time and denudation rates (1868); (7) ocean currents and the hemispherical temperature difference (1869); (8) feedbacks – a remarkable circumstance which led to changes of climate (1875); (9) temperature of space and its bearing on terrestrial physics (1880); (10) the causes of mild polar climates (1884).

T1  - Come hell or high water: climate action by archives, records and cultural heritage professionals in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2605478933
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to evidence the perspectives of information professionals in the UK in relation to environmental sustainability and climate action to catalyse collaborative action.Design/methodology/approachThis study takes an interpretivist stance. Research into archive and record management literature was conducted to establish key themes on climate change within the information sector. These themes informed research questions included in a survey cascaded to UK archivists, conservators, records managers and cultural heritage professionals via national mailing lists. The results were then codified and analysed. The study had research ethics and data protection approval from University College London.FindingsUsing professional ethics as a framework, this paper argues that climate action can protect records from the impact of climate change, ensuring future access. The information professionals surveyed were motivated by duties to preservation and access to mitigate the impact of the information sector on the environment. However, sector-specific climate action, such as introducing passive storage conditions or decreasing collection sizes, is limited by insufficient resources, organisational hierarchies and cultures, sector support and a perceived conflict with the duty to preservation.Originality/valueTo date, there is a growing body of literature from other countries on archival practices and the natural environment. However, the UK in general and the records management sector in particular, have not yet fully engaged in the discussion. This study reviews these knowledge gaps for the UK information sector to appropriately respond to climate change.

T1  - Corporate Environmental Performance, Climate Change Mitigation, and Green Innovation Behavior in Sustainable Finance
AN  - 2577803680
AB  - The purpose of this study was to empirically examine corporate environmental performance, climate change mitigation, and green innovation behavior in sustainable finance. Building my argument by drawing on data collected from Barclays, CPI, FiBraS, Finance Watch, GABV, GIZ, KPMG, LAB, Mission 2020, and UK Finance, I performed analyses and made estimates regarding the financial shift to net-zero emissions and climate-resilient growth. Descriptive statistics of compiled data from the completed surveys were calculated when appropriate. This survey employs statistical weighting procedures to clarify deviations in the survey sample from known population features, which is instrumental in correcting for differential survey participation and random variation in samples. Results are estimates and commonly are dissimilar within a narrow range around the actual value. The data was weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and nonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. The precision of the online polls was measured using a Bayesian credibility interval. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to test for the reliability and validity of measurement instruments.

T1  - Indicators of climate risk in the UK at different levels of warming
AN  - 2574786515
AB  - Assessments of the impacts of climate change are typically made using climate scenarios based on assumptions about future emissions of greenhouse gases, but policymakers and climate risk communicators are increasingly asking for information on impacts at different levels of warming. This paper provides this information for a set of indicators of climate risks in the UK for levels of warming up to 4 °C above pre-industrial levels. The results show substantial increases in climate risks at 2 °C, which is often inferred in the media to be a ‘safe’ level of climate change. In a 2 °C world, the chance of a heatwave is doubled, and the frequency of heat stress affecting people, crops and animals can be increased by a factor of five. Cooling degree days more than double, wildfire danger can increase by 40%–70%, the frequency of agricultural and water resources droughts doubles in England, and flood frequency in Wales increases by 50%. At 4 °C the increases in risk are considerably greater: heatwaves occur in virtually every year. The frequency of cold weather extremes reduces, but is not eliminated, with increasing warming. The rate of change in an indicator with warming varies across the UK. For temperature-based indicators this reflects variability in current climate, but for rainfall-based indicators reflects variations in the change in climate. Most indicators show a generally linear increase in risk with level of warming (although the change in risk from now is around 2.4 times higher in a 4 °C world than a 2 °C world because of warming experienced so far). However, some indicators—particularly relating to heat extremes—show a highly non-linear increase with level of warming. The range in change in indicator at a given level of warming is primarily caused by uncertainty in the estimated regional response of to increasing forcing.

T1  - Are citizen juries and assemblies on climate change driving democratic climate policymaking? An exploration of two case studies in the UK
AN  - 2573152519
AB  - In light of increasing pressure to deliver climate action targets and the growing role of citizens in raising the importance of the issue, deliberative democratic processes (e.g. citizen juries and citizen assemblies) on climate change are increasingly being used to provide a voice to citizens in climate change decision-making. Through a comparative case study of two processes that ran in the UK in 2019 (the Leeds Climate Change Citizens’ Jury and the Oxford Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Change), this paper investigates how far citizen assemblies and juries are increasing citizen engagement on climate change and creating more citizen-centred climate policymaking. Interviews were conducted with policymakers, councillors, professional facilitators and others involved in running these processes to assess motivations for conducting these, their structure and the impact and influence they had. The findings suggest the impact of these processes is not uniform: they have an indirect impact on policy making by creating momentum around climate action and supporting the introduction of pre-planned or pre-existing policies rather than a direct impact by truly being citizen-centred policy making processes or conducive to new climate policy. We conclude with reflections on how these processes give elected representatives a public mandate on climate change, that they help to identify more nuanced and in-depth public opinions in a fair and informed way, yet it can be challenging to embed citizen juries and assemblies in wider democratic processes.

T1  - Assessing the quality of state-of-the-art regional climate information: the case of the UK Climate Projections 2018
AN  - 2569483081
AB  - In this paper, we assess the quality of state-of-the-art regional climate information intended to support climate adaptation decision-making. We use the UK Climate Projections 2018 as an example of such information. Their probabilistic, global, and regional land projections exemplify some of the key methodologies that are at the forefront of constructing regional climate information for decision support in adapting to a changing climate. We assess the quality of the evidence and the methodology used to support their statements about future regional climate along six quality dimensions: transparency; theory; independence, number, and comprehensiveness of evidence; and historical empirical adequacy. The assessment produced two major insights. First, a major issue that taints the quality of UKCP18 is the lack of transparency, which is particularly problematic since the information is directed towards non-expert users who would need to develop technical skills to evaluate the quality and epistemic reliability of this information. Second, the probabilistic projections are of lower quality than the global projections because the former lack both transparency and a theory underpinning the method used to produce quantified uncertainty estimates about future climate. The assessment also shows how different dimensions are satisfied depending on the evidence used, the methodology chosen to analyze the evidence, and the type of statements that are constructed in the different strands of UKCP18. This research highlights the importance of knowledge quality assessment of regional climate information that intends to support climate change adaptation decisions.

T1  - OP85 General practitioners working in or alongside emergency departments in England: a qualitative study of general practitioners’ perspectives
AN  - 2569134625
AB  - BackgroundUp to 40% of Emergency Department attendances could be managed in primary care. In response, policies have led to the introduction of General Practitioner Services in/alongside Emergency Departments in England. Our aim was to capture General Practitioners’ perspectives of the service and their experiences in order to identify factors which may support or hinder General Practitioners working in Emergency Departments.MethodsQualitative study of 10 case sites where GPs were working in/alongside Emergency Departments at NHS sites in England. Data consisted of 186 direct non-participant observations and 226 semi-structured interviews with 191 health professionals, 42 of which were General Practitioners. This paper reports on a thematic analysis of 42 GP interviews and observations relating to GP practice.ResultsBoth system issues and individual characteristics influenced how General Practitioners viewed and experienced working within or alongside Emergency Departments. Themes identified were: A different kind of GP; Disillusionment with primary care; New ways of ‘doing’ general practice - portfolio working; A reciprocal relationship; Practical barriers and facilitators; Unintended consequences – impact on primary care. General Practitioners working in Emergency Departments saw personal benefits (flexible and portfolio working; less stressful and more supportive environment than traditional general practice; broadening of skills and experience) and systems benefits (sharing their knowledge and skills with secondary care; taking secondary care skills learned into primary care work; prolonging experienced General Practitioners’ working life and enthusing younger General practitioners). They also identified negative aspects. General Practitioners working in Emergency Departments saw themselves as different to ‘usual’ General Practitioners and were sceptical that a critical mass of General Practitioners willing and able to staff Emergency Departments effectively could be reached and sustained. There were remuneration and practical employment issues such as dysfunctional IT systems and contract/indemnity/insurance issues. General Practitioners felt that the General Practitioner in/alongside Emergency Department role should be supported professionally e.g. by the Royal Colleges. Finally, General Practitioners were concerned that employing General Practitioners in Emergency Departments may have the unintended consequence of depleting primary care general practice.ConclusionGeneral Practitioners’ perspectives of General Practice Services in or alongside Emergency Departments identify systems and individual benefits and issues which may be used by policy makers and managers when planning and implementing General Practitioner Services in/alongside Emergency Departments.

T1  - Multi-country stated preferences choice analysis for fresh tomatoes
AN  - 2566527300
AB  - In this study we investigate consumers’ preferences for fresh tomato attributes in four European countries by assessing and comparing Marginal Willingness-To-Pay (MWTP) estimates from panel Mixed Logit (MXL) models with utility specifications in the WTP-space. We performed an in-depth post-estimation inference to identify what attributes are the main determinants of fresh tomato purchases in each domestic market. We also assess the choice probabilities for tomatoes of various origins and types to illustrate how these post-estimation inference can be used to inform strategies designed to increase the market shares of Italian fresh tomato exports in new markets and to consolidate positions in markets where Italian fresh tomatoes are already appreciated by local consumers.

T1  - The anatomy of memory politics: a formalist analysis of Tate Britain’s ‘Artist and Empire’ and the struggle over Britain’s imperial past
AN  - 2564705927
AB  - In this paper, I propose a new approach for understanding the meaning of memory politics, which draws upon the archetypal literary criticism of Northrop Frye. I suggest that the four archetypes elaborated by Frye—comedy, romance, tragedy, and satire—can be used as a heuristic device for interpreting the contested historical narratives that are associated with the politics of memory. I illustrate this approach through a case-study of Artists and Empire: Facing Britain’s Imperial Past, an exhibition held at Tate Britain in 2016, amidst increasing contestation over the meaning of the British Empire. In sum, I find that the exhibit narrated Britain’s imperial past as a comedy, in which a key theme was the progressive cultural mixing of the British and the people they colonized. To conclude, I discuss the implications of such a narrative for constructing an inclusive, postcolonial British identity. As an alternative, I draw on Aristotle to suggest that a tragic narrative would have been more propitious.

T1  - Fossil Natural Gas Exit – A New Narrative for the European Energy Transformation Towards Decarbonization
AN  - 2563486093
AB  - This paper discusses the potential role of fossil natural gas in the process of the energy transformation in Europe on its way to decarbonization. Mainstream conventional wisdom has it that natural gas, perhaps in combination with other gases, should maintain an important role in the energy mix, first, as a "bridge fuel", and then through a gradual transition toward "decarbonized gases". However, when considering the ambitious climate targets of the EU and the subsequent need for far-reaching decarbonization, in combination with technical constraints and the results from our own energy system modeling, we arrive at a contrasting result: The disappearance of fossil natural gas and its corresponding infrastructure is the next logical step of the transformation process in Europe. The paper provides a review of the issues at stake and deconstructs the dominant narrative through a detailed technical description of different energy gases and their real climate effectiveness, as well as results from energy system modeling. We conclude that the phase-out of fossil natural gas in Europe needs to be completed towards 2040 in order to comply with climate targets and provide planning reliability for policy-makers and the industry.

T1  - The POLITICIZE dataset: an inventory of deliberative mini-publics (DMPs) in Europe
AN  - 2562654566
AB  - This note introduces the POLITICIZE dataset which contains information on the characteristics of 105 Deliberative Mini-Publics (DMPs) that took place in Europe between 2000 and 2020. Based on coding of experts regarding cases of real-life deliberative experiments in 18 different European countries, the dataset describes the core features of DMPs in Europe. It comprises information on three crucial dimensions: their composition (who deliberates?), their format (how do they deliberate?) and their role (what do they deliberate about and what are their prerogatives?). Hence, the note presents the different variables included in the dataset and reports empirical variations across them, thereby presenting the main contribution of the POLITICIZE dataset: delivering the most systematic and comprehensive efforts of data collection on mini-publics in Europe.

T1  - Bat Calls of Britain and Europe:&nbsp;A Guide to Species Identification
T2  - Bat Biology and Conservation
AN  - 2529963907
AB  - A comprehensive guide to the calls of the 44 species of bat currently known to occur in Europe. Following on from the popular British Bat Calls by Jon Russ, this new book draws on the expertise of more than forty specialist authors to substantially update all sections, further expanding the volume to include sound analysis and species identification of all European bats. Aimed at volunteers and professional alike, topics include the basics of sound, echolocation in bats, an introduction to acoustic communication, equipment used and call analysis. For each species, detailed information is given on distribution, emergence, flight and foraging behaviour, habitat, echolocation calls – including parameters of common measurements – and social calls. Calls are described for both heterodyne and time expansion/full spectrum systems. A simple but complete echolocation guide to all species is provided for beginners, allowing them to analyse call sequences and arrive at the most likely species or group. The book also includes access to a downloadable library of over 450 calls presented as sonograms in the species sections.

T1  - What next for local government climate emergency declarations? The gap between rhetoric and action
AN  - 2557143602
AB  - The UK, like other countries, has seen a proliferation of declarations of local climate emergencies. While these declarations have been interpreted as a demonstration of ambition, little is known about how and why they actually came about when they did and the implications this will have for what happens next. Focusing on London, UK, we present evidence collected via semi-structured interviews with experts and practitioners involved in the propagation of climate emergency declarations to critically explore how and why these declarations emerged, and the various different roles they are perceived to play for different local actors. Our findings reveal four journeys to local government declaration of a climate emergency (made actively from above, passively from above, actively from below, and passively from across) and three interwoven purposes (statements of intent, acting as a political gesture, and stimulating local action). We argue that these three purposes combine and coalesce to correlate the declaration of climate emergency with a local responsibility for emissions reduction, leaving little analytical space to question the scalar disconnect between the immediacy of the narrative at local scales and the slow-burning (and) global nature of the threat in question. If these emergency declarations are to be an opportunity for change in the governance of climate change, then the question of ‘what next?’ requires more in-depth, thorough and constructive engagement with the type of climate action the declarations are expected to induce while considering how this aligns with existing responsibilities and resource bases of local government.

T1  - “It’s on the ‘nice to have’ pile”: Potential principles to improve the implementation of socially inclusive Green Infrastructure
AN  - 2547167185
AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI) research tends to focus on the need for GI to enhance ecological processes, its potential to provide health and economic benefits, and on the barriers preventing its uptake. Yet there has been inadequate focus on the social aspects of GI. In the United Kingdom (UK) the need for GI is well established, such that policymakers and planners are now turning to the question of how GI should be implemented. Drawing on a mixed method research approach centring on practitioner experience, this paper identifies potential social principles that underpin GI and questions the extent to which these are being implemented in the UK. Results highlight the hitherto unexplored complexities of GI maintenance, the effects of austerity politics, and the role of local-level power dynamics on the implementation of GI. Findings have implications for international literature on GI as well as nature-based solutions more broadly.

T1  - Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on electricity demand in the UK based on multivariate time series forecasting with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory
AN  - 2540549440
AB  - Due to lockdown measures taken by the UK government during the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the national electricity demand profile presented a notably different performance. The Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis has provided a unique opportunity to investigate how such a landscape-scale lockdown can influence the national electricity system. However, the impacts of social and economic restrictions on daily electricity demands are still poorly understood. This paper investigated how the UK-wide electricity demand was influenced during the Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis based on multivariate time series forecasting with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory, to comprehend its correlations with containment measures, weather conditions, and renewable energy supplies. A deep-learning-based predictive model was established for daily electricity demand time series forecasting, which was trained by multiple features, including the number of coronavirus tests (smoothed), wind speed, ambient temperature, biomass, solar & wind power supplies, and historical electricity demand. Besides, the effects of Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Net-Zero target of 2050 were also studied through an interlinked approach.

T1  - Economic costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2557033481
AB  - Although the high costs of invasion are frequently cited and are a key motivation for environmental management and policy, synthesised data on invasion costs are scarce. Here, we quantify and examine the monetary costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom (UK) using a global synthesis of reported invasion costs. Invasive alien species have cost the UK economy between US$6.9 billion and $17.6 billion (£5.4 – £13.7 billion) in reported losses and expenses since 1976. Most costs were reported for the entire UK or Great Britain (97%); country-scale cost reporting for the UK's four constituent countries was scarce. Reports of animal invasions were the costliest ($4.7 billion), then plant ($1.3 billion) and fungal ($206.7 million) invasions. Reported damage costs (i.e. excluding management costs) were higher in terrestrial ($4.8 billion) than aquatic or semi-aquatic environments ($29.8 million), and primarily impacted agriculture ($4.2 billion). Invaders with earlier introduction years accrued significantly higher total invasion costs. Invasion costs have been increasing rapidly since 1976, and have cost the UK economy $157.1 million (£122.1 million) per annum, on average. Published information on specific economic costs included only 42 of 520 invaders reported in the UK and was generally available only for the most intensively studied taxa, with just four species contributing 90% of species-specific costs. Given that many of the invasive species lacking cost data are actively managed and have well-recognised impacts, this suggests that cost information is incomplete and that totals presented here are vast underestimates owing to knowledge gaps. Financial expenditure on managing invasions is a fraction (37%) of the costs incurred through damage from invaders; greater investments in UK invasive species research and management are, therefore, urgently required.

T1  - What does the UK public want farmland to look like?
AN  - 2555686308
AB  - As populations grow and demand for food rises, major shifts in global agri-food policy are likely to significantly impact agricultural land use. As the UK has now separated from the Common Agricultural Policy as it left the EU, Brexit offers a unique opportunity to create UK-specific agricultural policies that may dramatically shape both the countryside's appearance and the ecosystem services it provides. However, it is important to understand how the public – as taxpayers of agri-environment schemes – want the farmed countryside to look. To fill this knowledge gap, we undertook a novel mixed-methods study using a survey and collage-making workshops to understand aesthetic preferences for perceived "ideal" and "environmentally friendly" farm landscapes. Multinomial regression of data from a nationally representative survey of 2050 respondents demonstrated widespread support for agricultural landscapes containing trees and free-ranging livestock for ideal UK farm landscapes. Aesthetic preferences differed based on several socio-demographic variables, including gender, income and education. Landscapes with renewable energy technology, trees, and no livestock were perceived to be the most "environmentally friendly" farms, though wind turbines were visually unappealing. Eighty participants created collages of their ideal and environmentally friendly farming landscapes and completed a short survey to explain their choices. Qualitative thematic analysis of the collages and explanatory text found a desire for mosaic ideal farm landscapes focused either on agricultural or wild biological diversity. Results for the environmentally friendly farms reflected those in the survey. We discuss how our findings relate to implications for post-Brexit agricultural policy formation, particularly with regards to integrating public preferences around agri-food systems, to ensure tax-payers' views are considered.

T1  - The European Union roadmap for implementing nature-based solutions: A review
AN  - 2551932704; IND607341290
AB  - The present paper traces a chronological history, or roadmap, of the documentation produced by the European Union (EU) to promote and implement nature-based solutions (NBS) as an innovation action aiming to establish a socially inclusive, economically vibrant and ecologically resilient society. The EU’s ambition is to position Europe as the world leader in NBS Research (via scientific research aiming at generating knowledge and theories) and Innovation (NBS implementation via identifying innovative approaches and best practices), as well as in a global market (for sharing, communicating, collaborating and promoting NBS). Considerable efforts have been made by the European Commission (the executive branch of the EU) as featured in a number of documents, funding programmes and Horizon 2020 (Research and Innovation) projects that span the period from 2012 to 2020. While the European Commission’s commitment to promoting NBS within its Member States and beyond is still an ongoing process, we aim to review the efforts undertaken, knowledge gained, and practices accomplished. This roadmap intends to provide interested practitioners, policymakers, researchers, as well as civil organisations with an updated understanding of the leading role of the EU in NBS conceptualisation and operationalisation. This can inform future directions of NBS Research and Innovation actions, which in turn address environmental and societal challenges prompted by urbanisation/re-urbanisation, globalisation/de-globalisation, climate change and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Empirical estimate of forestation-induced precipitation changes in Europe
AN  - 2549478228
AB  - Land-cover changes can affect the climate by altering the water and energy balance of the land surface. Numerous modelling studies have indicated that alterations at the land surface can result in considerable changes in precipitation. Yet land-cover-induced precipitation changes remain largely unconstrained by observations. Here we use an observation-based continental-scale statistical model to show that forestation of rain-fed agricultural land in Europe triggers substantial changes in precipitation. Locally, we find an increase in precipitation following forestation, in particular in winter, which is supported by a paired rain-gauge analysis. In addition, forests are estimated to increase downwind precipitation in most regions during summer. By contrast, the downwind effect in winter is positive in coastal areas but near neutral and negative in Continental and Northern Europe, respectively. The combined local and non-local effects of a realistic reforestation scenario, constrained by sustainability safeguards, are estimated to increase summer precipitation by 7.6 ± 6.7% on average over Europe (0.13 ± 0.11 mm d–1), potentially offsetting a substantial part of the projected precipitation decrease from climate change. We therefore conclude that land-cover-induced alterations of precipitation should be considered when developing land-management strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.Forestation over Europe triggers substantial local and downwind precipitation changes, according to results from an observation-based continental-scale statistical model.

T1  - Gene editing of livestock: Sociotechnical imaginaries of scientists and breeding companies in the Netherlands
AN  - 2738664119
AB  - Gene editing technologies allow users to make in vivo (live) changes to an organism’s DNA. Advances in the field of gene editing have made it arguably more precise, efficient, flexible, and cheaper compared to previous technologies. This has generated an upsurge of interest in gene editing and its governance, including in livestock applications. Although gene editing in livestock promises benefits, it also raises technical, ethical, and societal questions alongside the prospect of (radical) transformation. Since the technology is still to be developed into marketable products, it is the designs, visions, or what we term “sociotechnical imaginaries” that shape gene editing technologies and that represent an important site for sociological inquiry. In this article, based on an analysis of interviews with breeding company representatives and agricultural scientists in the Netherlands, we analyze the assumptions, values, and commitments that underpin their imaginaries. These imaginaries matter, since their negotiation will help structure how the technology develops and how it will subsequently transform livestock and human–animal relations. In our analysis, we analyze the discursive practices from the interview data distilling three sociotechnical imaginaries that shape and underpin how respondents discuss gene editing in livestock. Elaborating the sociotechnical imaginary concept to make it more amenable to the emerging dynamics of gene editing in livestock, we show how imaginaries need to be studied “in place” and in terms of “material practices.” Even though each of the imaginaries frame livestock gene editing as desirable and beneficial, they nevertheless have differential effects in how they structure industry, researcher, government, and consumer/citizen relations. We conclude by discussing how and why sociotechnical imaginaries on livestock gene editing matter and their implications for governance and research.

T1  - East-West Divide in the European Union: Legacy or Developmental Failure?
AN  - 2682878559
AB  - EU goes through a realignment process in the context of the demise of multilateralism, yet the impact of this process on the 11 new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is rarely discussed. There is a persistent East-West divide in the EU that is mainly socio-economic, even though often narrated as a political divide between older and newer Member States. The article explores in depth the current developmental metrics in CEE and argues that the progress that has been achieved in overall levels of convergence in the EU is yet to be reflected at subnational level, where great disparities persist. It is the developmental divide that continues to inform political divisions in Europe.

T1  - Investigating the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services in UK agro-ecosystems: An application of the DPSIR framework
AN  - 2555685415
AB  - Understanding how climate change will affect agro-ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide is a significant global challenge. Investigating this topic requires a holistic approach that can capture the complexity of agro-ecosystems and assess impacts on the physical, biological, and socio-economic aspects of the system. The Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework is a problem structuring method commonly used in environmental policy and management to collate and synthesise multidisciplinary evidence. By reviewing relevant literature and policy documents, we created a DPSIR framework characterising the impacts of climate change on some key ecosystem services directly generated by farmland biodiversity, using UK agriculture as a case study. We focussed on three groups of service providers: pollinators, pest regulators and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used the standard DPSIR framework to establish broad-scale relationships, before developing two extensions to the initial DPSIR, which together formed a novel three-step approach. The second step allowed detailed exploration of the cause-effect relationships between different features of the agro-ecosystem, including cascading impacts on ecosystem services. This process highlighted knowledge gaps relating to the impacts of climate change on species interactions and cultural services. The third step provided a visual summary of the expected directional trends for the different features of UK agro-ecosystems, based upon current evidence. This demonstrated negative impacts on biodiversity, soil quality, crop yields and a wide variety of ecosystem services and goods, which can only be addressed effectively with targeted policies. The novel three-step DPSIR approach developed here would be useful for modelling other complex systems where management is impeded by knowledge gaps and the availability of accessible syntheses of current evidence.

T1  - Tax reform and redistribution for a better recovery
AN  - 2552288156
AB  - A regressive tax system and welfare cuts under ideological austerity have generated growing poverty and inequality in the UK and US. Failures in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting deep recession have the greatest impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, exacerbating poverty and inequality. In contrast to this depressing history, we show in detail that a better recovery in the UK requires a radical tax reform and a universal basic income, combined with a Green New Deal for full employment and a low-carbon economy, employee self-determination and economic democracy to eliminate exploitation and establish social justice.

T1  - United kingdom energy survey considerations for enhancement of sustainable engineering
AN  - 2548715539
AB  - The UK is dedicated to dropping its greenhouse gas emissions by not less than 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Therefore, the economy of the UK should be changed while confirming secure, low-carbon energy supplies to 2050. In most organizations, energy is one of the most substantial manageable costs. Energy-saving expands profitability along with reducing CO2 emissions and dropping impact on the environment. In this study, to determine the current energy usage of the gymnasium building, an Energy Survey was conducted at the facility assessing the following areas: a. Lighting and switching. b. Heating and Insulation. c. Appliances. d. Water usage. e. Windows. f. Building structure. These features are taken into the current study considerations for green buildings: Efficiently use of energy, availability of renewable energy sources, water resources, reduction in the waste, usage of non-toxic materials, enable reuse and recycling, good indoor air quality, and consider the quality of life of the occupants. The study provided several recommendations to reduce the energy usage of the fitness center. The results achieved a significant reduction in energy consumption at higher financial savings. From assumptions made by replacing all fluorescent luminaire tubes with compatible LED, the annual savings in energy would be approximately 104,000 kWh and a cost saving of £16,500. Replacing a 3 kW water heater with a 3 × 2 kW power shower, the total energy saving per year is 31937.5 kW that equate to £5078.06 and so on to other facilities.

T1  - “It Often Feels Like You Are Talking to a Wall”: Police and Private Security Responses to the Campaign to Protect Pont Valley Against Opencast Coal Extraction
AN  - 2537008444
AB  - Conflict between police, private security and political protesters is a topic that has been researched widely in criminology and other disciplines (e.g., Choudry 2019; Gilmore et al. 2019; Goyes and South 2017; Jackson et al. 2018; Rigakos 2002; South 1988; Weiss 1978). Adopting a green criminological lens, this article seeks to contribute to this rich body of research by examining police and private security responses to campaigning against opencast (open-pit) coal mining in Pont Valley, County Durham, United Kingdom (UK). Based on qualitative interviews, the article examines activists’ perceptions of responses to their campaign. Our findings reveal that rather than acting as neutral arbiters, police colluded with private interests, overlooking the abusive behavior of private security and bailiffs, particularly during the eviction of a protest camp at the proposed mining site. Activists believed that their right to protest was not respected, that their safety was jeopardized, and that police had willfully ignored a wildlife crime perpetrated by the mining company in order to enable mining to go ahead. Our article argues that the Pont Valley case fits into a wider pattern of repression of environmentalism in the UK, supporting Gilmore and colleagues’ (2019) argument that a progressive transformation in policing has been overstated.

T1  - Unilateral climate policies can substantially reduce national carbon pollution
AN  - 2536660533
AB  - Following the failure of climate governance regimes that sought to impose legally binding treaty-based obligations, the Paris Agreement relies on voluntary actions by individual countries. Yet, there is no guarantee that unilateral policies will lead to a decrease in carbon emissions. Critics worry that voluntary climate measures will be weak and ineffective, and insights from political economy imply that regulatory loopholes are likely to benefit carbon-intensive sectors. Here, we empirically evaluate whether unilateral action can still reduce carbon pollution by estimating the causal effect of the UK’s 2001 Climate Change Programme (CCP) on the country’s carbon emissions. Existing efforts to evaluate the overall impact of climate policies on national carbon emissions rely on Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenarios to project what carbon emissions would have been without a climate policy. We instead use synthetic control methods to undertake an ex post national-level assessment of the UK’s CCP without relying on parametric BAU assumptions and demonstrate the potential of synthetic control methods for climate policy impact evaluation. Despite setting lax carbon targets and making substantial concessions to producers, we show that, in 2005, the UK’s CO2 emissions per capita were 9.8% lower relative to what they would have been if the CCP had not been passed. Our findings offer empirical confirmation that unilateral climate policies can still reduce carbon emissions, even in the absence of a binding global climate agreement and in the presence of regulatory capture by industry.

T1  - Reeves’ muntjac populations continue to grow and spread across Great Britain and are invading continental Europe
AN  - 2508715782
AB  - The appropriate response for controlling an invasive non-native species depends on the extent to which its invasion has progressed, which can be revealed by information on its distribution and abundance. Reeves’ muntjac is a native deer to China and Taiwan, but has been introduced and become well-established in Great Britain. Moreover, in recent years, reports and verified records in the wild from other European countries have become more frequent. We reviewed the status of Reeves’ muntjac in Britain and evaluated its national range expansion from 2002 to 2016. While the British population appears to have tripled in size since 1995, the rate at which it has expanded its range seems to have peaked at approximately 12% per year between 2002 and 2005 and has since declined. We also consolidated observations on its international distribution, including a conservative evaluation of its presence in zoological collections. We predict that this species could expand its range to include every European country, although the availability of suitable landcover and climate is likely to vary substantially between countries. To prevent the significant impacts to conservation interests that have been observed in Great Britain from extending across Europe, national administrations should consider eradicating Reeves’ muntjac while that is still feasible.

T1  - To till or not to till in a temperate ecosystem? Implications for climate change mitigation
AN  - 2518767823
AB  - The management of agricultural soils affect the composition and scale of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is conflicting evidence on the effect of zero-tillage on carbon storage and GHG emissions. Here we assess the effects of zero-tillage over a range of time frames (1–15 years) on carbon storage and GHG release and their controls in the UK Net global warming potential was 30% lower under zero-tillage systems, due to lower carbon dioxide fluxes, with the greatest impacts after longer periods of zero-tillage management. Simultaneously, in zero-tillage systems, soil carbon stocks and the proportion of sequestered recalcitrant carbon increased while the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration decreased with time, compared to conventionally soils. We conclude that zero-tillage could play a crucial role in both reducing GHG emissions and at the same time increase soil carbon sequestration, therefore contributing to mitigate against climate change. Our findings are particularly important in the context of designing new policies (for example the Environmental Land Management Schemes in the UK) that ensure the sustainability of agricultural production in a changing climate.

T1  - A Comparison of Government Communication of Climate Change in Hong Kong and United Kingdom
AN  - 2676540050
AB  - As leaders of civil society, governments have a prime responsibility to communicate climate change information in order to motivate their citizens to mitigate and adapt. This study compares the approaches of the U.K. and Hong Kong governments. Although different in size and population, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong have similar climate change agendas to communicate to similarly educated and prosperous populations. The study finds that while both governments use similar means: policy, education, campaigns, internet, and social media, these have different characteristics, with different emphases in their climate change message. The United Kingdom’s top-down approach is more prominent in its legally binding policy and well-defined programs for adaptation and risk assessment. Hong Kong has more effectively embedded climate change education across the school curricula and has a more centralized and consistently branded campaign, with widespread use of visual language to connect the public to the problem. Hong Kong frames climate change as a science–society problem and has a greater focus on self-responsibility and bottom-up behavioral change. Thus, the U.K. and Hong Kong governments have polarized approaches to motivating their citizens into climate action. Moving forward, both governments should consider best practice elements of the other to develop their communication of climate change.

T1  - POLICY, HISTORY, THEORY: Labour and the environment: An historical perspective
AN  - 2561521104
AB  - Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership the Labour Party significantly shifted its environmental policy offer. Indeed, during the 2019 general election campaign a 'socialism or barbarism' rhetoric emerged on climate change, with die contest presented as 'the last roll of the dice for humanity to avert climate breakdown'. The suspicion that Keir Starmer may water down Labour's radicalism in this area has fed into his frost)' reception among some vocal supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. There is not an inevitable alliance between the left and environmentalists, as an examination of Labour's relationship with the modern environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrates. These two decades saw an unprecedented growth in the size and number of environmental groups, including a new party in the form of PEOPLE (later called the Ecology Party, and then the Green Party). Highlighting the tensions and synergies between Labour and the green movement, then, demonstrates that the party can meaningfully engage on the environment, but doing so will also involve confronting some uncomfortable trade-offs.

T1  - ‘Cosmovillagers’ as Sustainable Rural Development Actors in Mountain Hamlets? International Immigrant Entrepreneurs’ Perceptions of Sustainability in the Lleida Pyrenees (Catalonia, Spain)
AN  - 2550331282
AB  - In recent decades, small villages in some mountainous regions in Europe have been suffering from ageing and depopulation, yet at the same time, immigrants have been arriving and settling there. This paper sheds light on the perceptions of sustainable rural development among international immigrants living in municipalities with fewer than 500 inhabitants, which are already the home to some ‘cosmovillagers’. If immigrants’ views are left unattended, an important part of reality will be lacking in the picture of mountainous areas because today immigration is qualitatively relevant in rural Europe. This paper aims to answer the following questions, among others: What dimensions of sustainability are underscored? What are the main challenges for sustainability and the proposals for improvement? What are the local sustainability challenges? This paper provides research results and insights based on original data gathered during fieldwork in the Pyrenees as well as analyses of documents, maps and statistics. Specifically, the main focus is on some several sparsely populated areas in the Lleida Pyrenees, e.g. dozens of municipalities in Alt Urgell, Cerdanya, Pallars Sobirà and Val d’Aran. Thus this paper aims to help fill that relative gap in the existing academic literature by offering original qualitative information.

T1  - Potatoes, Populations, and States
AN  - 2516947672
AB  - Today, dietary guidelines, healthy-eating pyramids, and other nutritional advice are a familiar and expected feature of governance. This was not always the case; what we eat has not always been of such interest to the state. That people ate was of course very important-since ancient times, rulers have feared the disruptive effects of famine. The minutia of what ordinary folk ate, in contrast, was rarely considered an essential component of statecraft. Over the course of the eighteenth century, however, the diet of working people acquired unprecedented importance within European notions of statecraft because of its perceived capacity to foster or impede the expansion of a high-quality population. This article reviews these developments to show how during the Enlightenment, everyday eating habits acquired political relevance. Although scholars often identify the twentieth century as the period when food became an object of governance, food as a vital instrument of modern statecraft has a much longer history.

T1  - The carbon sequestration potential of Scottish native woodland
AN  - 2515181465
AB  - Woodland creation sequesters carbon and contributes to climate change mitigation. Most previous assessments of the carbon sequestration of new UK woodlands have focused on tree planting, little is known about the scale of the potential contribution from natural regeneration. We used a Potential for Native Woodland Model to make the first estimate of carbon sequestration by large-scale native woodland expansion through natural regeneration in Scotland. We estimate native woodland could expand to cover an additional 3.9 million hectares of the Scottish uplands removing an average of 6.96 million tons of CO2 per year. This represents 35%–45% of the carbon removal target for UK woodlands that has been suggested by the UK Committee on Climate Change. Expanding woodlands to just 10% of this potential would double existing native woodland and could provide a multitude of benefits, including carbon removal equivalent to approximately 4% of this target. The next few decades are critical in terms of climate change mitigation, therefore further work is now required to improve these estimates and better constrain this potentially large contribution.

The sample was stratified by age and gender with quotas defined according to the 2011 UK census distribution.Setting:Qualtrics’ Online panel of respondents in the UK.Participants:676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n 341) and males (n 335) and a majority (58·6 %) from households whose income was <£30 000.Results:Our findings showed that nearly 40 % of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively.Conclusions:Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for (a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers’ diet-related cognitions and behaviours and (b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.

T1  - Thirty years of climate mitigation: lessons from the 1989 options appraisal for the UK
AN  - 2508022410
AB  - In April 1989, the UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, convened a full cabinet meeting on climate change addressed by leading scientists. The presentation on mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions was made by the Head of the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), Ken Currie, and identified the key potential options for mitigation by 2020. In this paper, we compare the mitigation potential identified for each proposed option with the 2019 outturn. The largest mitigation options identified were improved end use energy efficiency across the economy and the generation and use of low carbon electricity. Our analysis finds that these have been the key options adopted. Reductions in primary energy use, resulting from improvements in energy efficiency were concentrated in the period 2005–2012 which in 1989 were widely considered to be ambitious. Decarbonisation of electricity has been achieved by the displacement of coal, initially by gas and more recently by renewable electricity. Renewable electricity has exceeded 1989 expectations in the last 5 years and is now the biggest source of CO2 reductions from electricity generation. The contribution envisaged by nuclear electricity has not occurred, largely due its failure to compete in liberalised generation markets. In all cases, the policy environment has been important. We draw lessons for mitigation options to achieve the goal of net zero emissions in the next 30 years. The contribution of demand side and other modular options will remain crucial, as mass-produced technologies tend to improve more quickly than those requiring large construction projects. Environmental, social and political factors will be important, so analysis should not be a purely techno-economic assessment.

T1  - Uncertainty of modelled bioenergy with carbon capture and storage due to variability of input data
AN  - 2498861712
AB  - Uncertainty is inherent in modelled projections of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), yet sometimes treated peripherally. One source of uncertainty comes from different climate and soil inputs. We investigated variations in 70‐year UK projections of Miscanthus × giganteus (M × g), BECCS and environmental impacts with input data. We used cohort datasets of UKCP18 RCP8.5 climate projections and Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) soil sequences, as inputs to the MiscanFor bioenergy model. Low annual yield occurred 1 in 10 years as a UK‐average but yield uncertainty varied regionally, especially south and east England. BECCS projections were similar among cohorts, with variation resulting from climate cohorts of the same database ensemble (3.99 ± 0.14 t C ha−1 year−1) larger than uncertainty resulting from soil sequences in each grid block (3.96 ± 0.03 t C ha−1 year−1). This is supported by annual time series, displaying variable annual climate and a close yield–BECCS–climate relationship but partial correspondence of yield and BECCS with maximal soil variability. Each HWSD soil grid square contains up to 10 ranked soil types. Predominant soil commonly has over 50% coverage, indicating why BECCS from combined soil sequences were not significantly different from BECCS using the dominant soil type. Mean BECCS from the full climate ensemble combined with the full soil sequences, over the current area of cropping limits in England and Wales, is 3.98 ± 0.14 t C ha−1 year−1. The bioenergy crop has a mean seasonal soil water deficit of 65.79 ± 4.27 mm and associated soil carbon gain of 0.22 ± 0.03 t C ha−1 year−1, with bioenergy feedstock calculated at 131 GJ t−1 y−1. The uncertainty is specific to the input datasets and model used. The message of this study is to ensure that uncertainty is accounted for when interpreting modelled projections of land use impacts.

T1  - Walking behaviour in the ground beetle, Poecilus cupreus: dispersal potential, intermittency and individual variation
AN  - 2496978173
AB  - Dispersal is a key ecological process affecting community dynamics and the maintenance of populations. There is increasing awareness of the need to understand individual dispersal potential to better inform population-level dispersal, allowing more accurate models of the spread of invasive and beneficial insects, aiding crop and pest management strategies. Here, fine-scale movements of Poecilus cupreus, an important agricultural carabid predator, were recorded using a locomotion compensator and key movement characteristics were quantified. Net displacement increased more rapidly than predicted by a simple correlated random walk model with near ballistic behaviour observed. Individuals displayed a latent ability to head on a constant bearing for protracted time periods, despite no clear evidence of a population level global orientation bias. Intermittent bouts of movement and non-movement were observed, with both the frequency and duration of bouts of movement varying at the inter- and intra-individual level. Variation in movement behaviour was observed at both the inter- and intra- individual level. Analysis suggests that individuals have the potential to rapidly disperse over a wider area than predicted by simple movement models parametrised at the population level. This highlights the importance of considering the role of individual variation when analysing movement and attempting to predict dispersal distances.

T1  - Not teaching what we practice: undergraduate conservation training at UK universities lacks interdisciplinarity
AN  - 2502723481
AB  - The practice and science of conservation have become increasingly interdisciplinary, and it is widely acknowledged that conservation training in higher education institutions should embrace interdisciplinarity in order to prepare students to address real-world conservation problems. However, there is little information on the extent to which conservation education at the undergraduate level meets this objective. I carried out a systematic search of undergraduate conservation degree programmes in the UK and conducted a simple text analysis of module descriptions to quantify the extent to which they provide social science training. I found 47 programmes, of which 29 provided module descriptions. Modules containing social science content ranged from 3.8% to 52.2% of modules across programmes, but only 55.2% of programmes offered a social-focused conservation module, and only one programme offered a module in social science research methods. On average, almost half of the modules offered (46.2%) comprised biology and ecology modules with no conservation focus, and 17.9% comprised skills-based modules (research and vocational skills). Conservation-focused modules comprised a mean of only 22.5% of modules. These results show that undergraduate conservation teaching in the UK is still largely biocentric and is failing to deliver the interdisciplinary education that is widely called for.

T1  - How complete are insect inventories? An assessment of the british butterfly database highlighting the influence of dynamic distribution shifts on sampling completeness
AN  - 2493882490
AB  - Much recent scientific, media and public attention has focussed on the evidence for and consequences of declines in insect biodiversity. Reliable, complete inventories can be used to estimate insect trends accurately, but incomplete data may distort assessments of biodiversity change. Thus, it is essential to understand the completeness of insect inventories. Assessing the database of Great Britain butterfly occurrences, likely the most complete database for any group of insects in the world (with 10,046,366 records for 58 butterfly species), we found that only 62% of the cells have complete inventories at the finest scale evaluated. The dynamic nature of butterfly distributions in response to climate change could explain this result, as the distribution of completeness values is related to the increasing occurrence of some species at higher latitudes as a consequence of recent range expansions. The exceptional quantity of information collected in Great Britain about this appealing group of insects is insufficient to provide a complete picture. Consequently, we cannot expect to build complete inventories for less popular taxa, especially in less comprehensively sampled countries, and will require other techniques to understand the full extent of global biodiversity loss.

T1  - How does research performativity and selectivity impact on the non-core regions of Europe? The case for a new research agenda
AN  - 2483427709
AB  - Higher education systems are caught between two dynamic processes, one referring to economic value and the other to status value. Although these political rationalities are presented as part of a coherent programme of reform and ‘modernization’, they pull higher education systems and the actors within them in contradictory directions. Their impact can collectively be referred to as research selectivity, since these rationalities encompass both research performativity and institutional practices of recognition and reward and subjective strategies. In this paper, we first aim to map the dominant orientations of higher education studies research and how they reflect the relationship between neoliberalism and the restructuring of higher education systems and research infrastructure. Our reading shows that this is a significant context for inquiring into research selectivity as it is enacted and, at the same time, suggests that we need to pay attention to the privileging of existing centres of higher education research and the relative absence of sustained focus on research selectivity in the non-core regions of Europe. Secondly, the paper puts forward the case for a sustained research agenda that focuses specifically on the identification of the differential impact of processes of research selectivity in non-core regions of Europe, organized around three intersecting themes – linguistic, epistemological, and disciplinary impact. Arguing for the importance and relevance of this research agenda for empirical research in Europe and globally, the paper emphasizes that its main objective is to create a critical space within which we can, collectively, think higher education otherwise.

T1  - Scientific Opinion on the assessment of the control measures of the category A diseases of Animal Health Law: African Horse Sickness
AN  - 2697047513
AB  - EFSA received a mandate from the European Commission to assess the effectiveness of some of the control measures against diseases included in the Category A list according to Regulation (EU) 2016/429 on transmissible animal diseases (‘Animal Health Law’). This opinion belongs to a series of opinions where these control measures will be assessed, with this opinion covering the assessment of control measures for African Horse Sickness (AHS). In this opinion, EFSA and the AHAW Panel of experts review the effectiveness of: (i) clinical and laboratory sampling procedures, (ii) monitoring period and (iii) the minimum radius of the protection and surveillance zone, and the minimum duration of measures in these zones. The general methodology used for this series of opinions has been published elsewhere; nonetheless, specific details of the transmission kernels used for the assessment of the minimum radius of the protection and surveillance zones are shown. Several scenarios for which these control measures were assessed were designed and agreed prior to the start of the assessment. In summary, sampling procedures described in the diagnostic manual for AHS were considered efficient for all Equidae considering the high case fatality rate expected. The monitoring period (14 days) was assessed as effective in every scenario, except for those relating to the epidemiological enquiry where the risk manager should consider increasing the monitoring period, based on the awareness of keepers, environmental conditions and the vector abundance in the region. The current protection zone (100 km) comprises more than 95% of the infections from an affected establishment. Both the radius and duration of the zones could be reduced, based on local environmental conditions and the time of year of the first index case. Recommendations provided for each of the scenarios assessed aim to support the European Commission in the drafting of further pieces of legislation relating to AHS.

T1  - Identifying economic and societal drivers of engagement in agri-environmental schemes for English dairy producers
AN  - 2524231193; IND607182289
AB  - Livestock production is under increasing scrutiny regarding its impacts on the environment and its wider role in climate change. Consequently, there are a growing number of private agri-environmental schemes (AES) now operating alongside public AES that offer farmers economic rewards to maintain and enhance the environment. This study focused exclusively on a small number of commercial dairy producers located in the North West of England who were all suppliers of a global food producer and members of the producer’s own private AES. The study explored the economic and societal drivers of adoption of agri-environmental behaviours and perceptions of the private processor AES.The study adopted a mixed-method approach. In Stage 1 a structured questionnaire was used to explore the role of an AES offered by the global food processor in the financial stability and environmental sustainability of dairy farms (n = 20). The survey sought to understand the range of interventions adopted, explore future adoption intentions and identify possible ways in which AESs could be extended. The results from the questionnaire were explored further in Stage 2, through qualitative in-depth interviews (n = 12). A thematic analysis approach was taken to describe the key themes that motivated farmer engagement in agri-environmental schemes.Overall, farmers felt that income from the private AES provided stability and resilience to their businesses, permitting them to have greater confidence in business planning and budgeting for the upcoming year. The majority of the farmers were not part of a public AES, but were already undertaking some agri-environmental behaviours and were motivated to join the private scheme primarily by financial incentives and by a desire to maintain the natural environment. A minority of respondents identified that the financial incentives offered had directly motivated a behaviour change. Decisions over which agri-environmental behaviours to adopt were driven by the existing animal management practices, geography and landscape of the farm.Farmers compared the private scheme favourably to available public AESs, which they perceived as more restrictive and providing insufficient reward for the “red tape” involved. In contrast, private scheme membership was perceived to have been beneficial for both their farm business and the local environment, and many reported personal satisfaction from engagement in agri-environmental behaviours. It is important that the design of future public AES does not “crowd out” private schemes, giving farmers increasing AES choice and increasing the overall amount of funding available for the delivery of public goods from agriculture.

T1  - Food justice for all?: searching for the ‘justice multiple’ in UK food movements
AN  - 2489439287
AB  - In this paper, we examine diverse political philosophical conceptualisations of justice and interrogate how these contested understandings are drawn upon in the burgeoning food justice scholarship. We suggest that three interconnected dimensions of justice—plurality, the spatial–temporal and the more-than-human—deserve further analytical attention and propose the notion of the ‘justice multiple’ to bring together a multiplicity of framings and situated practices of (food) justice. Given the lack of critical engagement food justice has received as both a concept and social movement in the context of the United Kingdom (UK), we draw upon empirical research with practitioners and activists involved with heterogenous food movements working at the local, regional and national level and apply the justice multiple concept to the interview data. We highlight the diverse ways that justice is discussed in terms of access, fairness, empowerment, rights and dignity that reflect established organisational discursive framings and the fragmented nature of food system advocacy and activism. Based on this insight, we argue that a plurivocal, relational conceptualisation of socioecological justice can help enhance the multiple politics of food justice, pluralise UK food movement praxis and nurture avenues for broader coalition-building across the food system.

T1  - Building stock energy modeling: Feasibility study on selection of important input parameters using stepwise regression
AN  - 2484430588
AB  - Building energy assessment is essential to accomplish the sustainable energy targets of new and present buildings. Retrofitting of the existing buildings by assessing them through energy models is the most prominent method. Studies revealed that there is still blank information about the building stocks, and these affect the valuation of building energy efficiency policies. Literature also recommends that the existing energy models are too complex and unreliable to predict the energy use. Reliability of such energy models would improve through a better alignment of the input parameters and the model assumptions. The authors hypothesized that the reliability of models would be improved through identification of the most relevant energy use parameters for the building stocks in different regions and models. One of the most commonly accepted methods for detecting the most dominant input parameters is sensitivity analysis, though its shortcomings include the need for a large number of data samples and long computing time. In this research, the Energy, Carbon, and Cost Assessment for Buildings Stocks (ECCABS) model is adopted to identify the most important parameters of the presented model. The research team uses the model that has been validated by studies conducted for the UK building stock. Moreover, by assessing the feasibility study with the stepwise regression to identify the significant input parameters have been discussed. Results show that stepwise regression method could produce the same results compared to sensitivity analysis. This paper also indicates that stepwise regression is considerably faster and less computationally intensive compared to common sensitivity analysis methods.

T1  - Male warriors and worried women? Understanding gender and perceptions of security threats
AN  - 2476520104
AB  - Differences between women and men in perceptions of security threats are firmly established in public opinion research, with the ‘male warrior’ and the ‘worried woman’ two well-documented stereotypes. Yet, we argue in this article, the differences are not as well understood as such labels, or the search for explanations, imply. One reason for this is the lack of dialogue between public opinion research and feminist security studies. In bringing the two fields into conversation by analysing mixed methods research data gathered in Britain, we suggest that while the extent of the gender gap in opinions of security is overstated, the gaps that do exist are more complex than previously allowed: men and women define ‘security’ in slightly different ways; women tend to identify more security threats than men not necessarily because they feel more threatened but due to a greater capacity to consider security from perspectives beyond their own; women are more confident about the government's ability to deal with security threats in the future but not simply because of greater faith in government than men. This complexity implies a need to revisit assumptions, methods, and analytical approaches in order to develop the field of gender and security further.

AB  - Born into a medical family, Johnson's eyes were first opened to public health as a medical student at Newnham College, Cambridge, UK, where she spent an intercalated year studying social and political science.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic led directly to her leadership of the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) programme.

With Anthony Costello, she worked on the landmark 2009 UCL–Lancet Commission on Managing the Health Effects of Climate Change, later joining the UK Government's Climate Change Adaptation Sub-Committee, with its annual reports helping to shape national climate change policy.

T1  - Realist evaluation of the implementation and impact of the NHS carbon reduction strategy in the UK
AN  - 2724919258
AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the extent to which organisational factors facilitate or inhibit the implementation of the National Health Service (NHS) carbon reduction strategy within acute hospital settings.SettingA single acute NHS Trust with four satellite sites which serve more than 2 million patients annually in Central England.ParticipantsInterviews with a purposive sample of 10 stakeholders, including those who conceptualised the intervention and those who were responsible for its implementation.InterventionThe NHS is a major carbon emitter and therefore developed the ‘NHS carbon reduction strategy (NHSCRS)’ in 2009. NHS organisations are contractually obliged to develop a local carbon reduction strategy known as a Sustainable Development Management Plan (SDMP) which details carbon reduction measures (CRM), as described in the NHSCRS. However, the organisational context within which the SDMP is implemented is likely to determine the extent of its success. We undertook an adapted realist evaluation cycle to develop refined initial programme theories. Documents were analysed using thematic content analysis. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsCRM were most likely to be implemented if the Trust Board were sufficiently pressured by staff and reputational fears, and the potential impacts of CRM were perceived to align with wider organisational aims. Differences in implementation of CRM across hospital sites were related to logistical factors, accessibility to regional partners and contractual relationships. There were expected carbon, energy and long-term financial savings, with variability in the effectiveness of some CRM post implementation.ConclusionsOrganisational factors, particularly Board leadership and internal implementation pathways, have a significant bearing on whether CRM are implemented or not. However, greater national support and guidance is needed for NHS organisations to effectively reduce their carbon emissions. Further cycles of this evaluation are necessary in multiple case study sites to illuminate the path to a net-zero NHS carbon footprint by 2045.

AB  - Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world, a state of affairs health professionals have been bringing attention to for decades.1 The science is unequivocal; a global increase of 1.5°C above the preindustrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.2 3 Despite the world’s necessary preoccupation with COVID-19, we cannot wait for the pandemic to pass to rapidly reduce emissions.

In the past 20 years, heat-related mortality among people aged over 65 has increased by more than 50%.4 Higher temperatures have brought increased dehydration and renal function loss, dermatological malignancies, tropical infections, adverse mental health outcomes, pregnancy complications, allergies, and cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality.5 6 Harms disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including children, older populations, ethnic minorities, poorer communities and those with underlying health problems.2 4 Global heating is also contributing to the decline in global yield potential for major crops, falling by 1.8%–5.6% since 1981; this, together with the effects of extreme weather and soil depletion, is hampering efforts to reduce undernutrition.4 Thriving ecosystems are essential to human health, and the widespread destruction of nature, including habitats and species, is eroding water and food security and increasing the chance of pandemics.3 7 8 The consequences of the environmental crisis fall disproportionately on those countries and communities that have contributed least to the problem and are least able to mitigate the harms.

Emissions reduction plans do not adequately incorporate health considerations.12 Concern is growing that temperature rises above 1.5°C are beginning to be seen as inevitable, or even acceptable, to powerful members of the global community.13 Relatedly, current strategies for reducing emissions to net zero by the middle of the century implausibly assume that the world will acquire great capabilities to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.14 15 This insufficient action means that temperature increases are likely to be well in excess of 2°C,16 a catastrophic outcome for health and environmental stability.

Better air quality alone would realise health benefits that easily offset the global costs of emissions reductions.22 These measures will also improve the social and economic determinants of health, the poor state of which may have made populations more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic.23 But the changes cannot be achieved through a return to damaging austerity policies or the continuation of the large inequalities of wealth and power within and between countries.

T1  - Climate Change and the Spatiotemporal Variation in Survival of a Long-Distance Migrant (White Stork, Ciconia ciconia) across Western Europe
AN  - 2656368648
AB  - Simple SummaryAlthough impacts of climate change at the population level are frequently reported in the scientific literature, the effects of global warming on particular individuals are not well-known, specifically when it comes to large spatial scales. However, understanding how the effects on individuals are translated into impacts in animal populations is key to getting insight into the consequences of climate change for species conservation. We used ring recoveries of White Storks across western Europe to assess the influence of different environmental factors on the survival of this long-distance migratory bird. We found that both the shape and the strength of the relationship between climate warming and survival differ across age groups, with juvenile White Storks more strongly affected. Furthermore, we found a decline in survival which is particularly marked for those storks breeding in southern Europe. The large-scale effect of climatic conditions identified in this widespread and common long-distance migrant species represents a highly likely scenario for other migratory birds in Europe.AbstractThe spatial variation in the strength of climate change may lead to different impacts on migratory birds using different breeding areas across a region. We used a long-term data series of White Stork ring recoveries to study the temporal and spatial variation of annual survival rates of White Stork across western Europe between 1960 and 2009 in relation to climatic and environmental conditions at their breeding and wintering grounds. White Stork survival was estimated from the Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) model using a cohort-based analysis. Our results support that climate change has caused a gradual decline in the survival performance of western European White Storks during the study period. Both the shape and the strength of the relationship between climate warming and survival differ among different life-stages of the individual development, with juvenile White Storks more strongly affected. The decline in survival is particularly marked for those storks breeding in southern Europe. The large-scale effect of climatic conditions identified in this widespread long-distance migrant species represents a highly likely scenario for other migratory birds in Europe.

T1  - Exploring the Potential of a Gamified Approach to Reduce Energy Use and Carbon Emissions in the Household Sector
AN  - 2650199314
AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of an innovative approach based on gamification to promote reduced energy consumption in social housing. The game was developed and validated under the auspices of the EU-funded project EnerGAware-Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities in an affordable housing pilot located in Plymouth (United Kingdom). The results showed that the future exploitation of the game holds important energy- and emissions-saving potential. Assuming that the game is distributed freely by European energy providers to their domestic end-users, the game was found to be able to save more than 48.9 secondary terawatt-hours per year (TWhs) and 18.8 million tons of CO2e annually, contributing up to around 8% to the target set for the European buildings sector to keep global warming under 2 °C. The results also showed that the game is highly feasible from the energy point of view, even when we consider the energy consumed upstream, due to its low cumulative energy demand and its potential for household energy reduction. The results of this research provide helpful information for private and public stakeholders, as they contribute to determining the sustainability of promoting energy saving through gaming.

T1  - Science, Technology and Society: integrating social-science in the energy debate
AN  - 2637294828
AB  - This paper introduces key current themes in social sciences of energy that look beyond conventional concerns with energy consumers. Close, detailed studies of energy practices at all levels can offer insights into the ways that energy systems are enmeshed in social, legal, cultural, economic and political frameworks that pre-empt expectations about energy production, distribution and consumption. By bringing a sociological and anthropological focus onto the energy industries themselves, social sciences can offer new theoretical perspectives, reveal the political relations that accompany energy flows, and offer new ways to think about the potentials for current and future energy systems.Alternate abstract:
Este artigo apresenta as principais questões que as ciências sociais atuais visam frente ao estudo da energia, as quais superam o nível das preocupações convencionais com assuntos como o dos consumidores de energia. Estudos a profundidade e muito detalhados de práticas energéticas em todos os níveis podem fornecer uma visão das maneiras pelas quais os sistemas energéticos estão determinados pelas estruturas sociais, legais, culturais, econômicas e políticas e que permitem compreender melhor as expectativas sobre produção, distribuição e consumo de energia. Por meio duma abordagem sociológica e antropológica aplicada às próprias indústrias de energia, as ciências sociais podem oferecer novas perspectivas teóricas, revelar as relações políticas que acompanham os fluxos de energia e oferecer novas maneiras de pensar sobre as potencialidades dos sistemas energéticos atuais e futuros.Alternate abstract:

T1  - Impact on carbon emissions of online study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study
AN  - 2624151835
AB  - Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO
2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university.
Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled.
Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO
2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO
2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO
2.
Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO
2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

T1  - Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis
AN  - 2614934622
AB  - This study re-examines the impact of ESG (economic, environmental, social, and corporate governance performance) on the financial performance of UK firms. Most recent sample of 351 firms from FTSE350 for the time period 2002–2018 is used. The study estimates the impact of total ESG and individual dimensions of ESG on corporate financial performance using static and dynamic panel data techniques, and it also examines the impact of high and low ESG on firm financial performance. Further, the study investigates the role of firm size as a moderator in the relationship between ESG and firm financial performance. The results of total ESG performance indicate that ESG has a positive and significant impact on firm financial performance. However, in the case of the individual ESG performance, the results are mixed. Overall, the results confirm that high ESG firms show high financial performance as compared to low ESG firms. Results indicate that firm size moderates the relationship between ESG performance and firm financial performance.

T1  - Scaling Up Smart City Logistics Projects: The Case of the Smooth Project
AN  - 2612835554
AB  - A large number of smart city logistics projects fail to scale up, remaining a local experimental exercise. This lack of scalability is, in fact, commonly recognized as a major problem. This study aims to determine the key success factors related to the scalability of smart city logistics projects. The process of scaling up, which is articulated as expansion, roll-out, and replication, is defined as the ability of a system to improve its scale by aiming to meet the increasing volume demand. Specifically, this study investigates the scalability intended to be used as expansion and roll-out. A qualitative case study was conducted to fulfill the research purpose. The chosen case study is SMOOTh, a pilot project currently underway in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, involving a diverse group of companies including Volvo Group and DHL. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven of the project’s stakeholders. Through a thematic analysis, four categories and the respective success factors were identified. These were represented by a business model, as well as technical, stakeholder and regulatory factors. The paper concludes with observations and recommendations aimed at the pilot initiatives, adding new perspectives to the upscaling debate.

T1  - Effect of Climate Change and Occupant Behaviour on the Environmental Impact of the Heating and Cooling Systems of a Real Apartment. A Parametric Study through Life Cycle Assessment
AN  - 2612789651
AB  - Climate change has a strong influence on the energy consumption of buildings, affecting both the heating and cooling demand in the actual and future scenario. In this paper, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to evaluate the influence of both the occupant behaviour and the climate change on the environmental impact of the heating and cooling systems of an apartment located in southern Italy. The analysis was conducted using IPCC GWP and ReCiPe indicators as well as the Ecoinvent database. The influence of occupant behaviour was included in the analysis considering different usage profiles during the operational phase, while the effect of climate change was considered by varying the weather file every thirty years. The adoption of the real usage profiles showed that the impact of the systems was highly influenced by the occupant behaviour. In particular, the environmental impact of the heating system appeared more influenced by the operation hours, while that of the cooling system was more affected by the natural ventilation schedules. Furthermore, the influence of climate change demonstrated that more attention has to be dedicated to the cooling demand that in the future years will play an ever-greater role in the energy consumption of buildings.

T1  - Exploring the Potential for Electric Retrofit Regulations and an Accreditation Scheme for the UK
AN  - 2612762062
AB  - Electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Electric retrofits involve converting an ICE vehicle to an electric drivetrain, aiding the transition to zero emission vehicles by adapting current vehicles and, thus, reducing the transport sector emissions. Other benefits include charge exemptions in major cities, reduced driving costs, and lower maintenance. The UK has a considerable retrofit market, with a large price range of services offered. There is a varying level of practice undertaken and current regulations may not adequately cover these retrofits. Industrial engagement has highlighted the varying levels and common themes of practice, such as restoration work, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis. Converting the registered fuel type of a vehicle to electricity, post-retrofit, appears to be a limited process, with few steps. Therefore, a regulatory framework, such as an accreditation scheme, could be introduced to ensure high levels of safety and good practice. Future work suggestions include further meetings with the DVLA and DVSA, and meeting the Motor Insurers’ Bureau.

T1  - Belonging and Global Citizenship in a STEM University
AN  - 2612757591
AB  - For the past two decades, there has been a resurgence in the actualization of civic missions in universities; these universities have continued to demonstrate commitment to educate for the purpose of global citizenship. Global citizenship is both a skillset and a mindset. As universities engage in efforts to increase students’ capabilities for living and working in a diverse society, research in this area has often focused on students of social science disciplines in the United States, presenting an opportunity for an investigation into students’ sense of belonging and global citizenship in the STEM university context in the United Kingdom. Building on prior civic scholarship, which defines citizenship in part as a sense of belonging, this paper presents interview data from a longitudinal, mixed-methods study at a STEM university in the United Kingdom to explore the meanings and experiences of students’ belonging in a multicultural institution, and their attitudes about current political issues before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study presents theoretical and practical implications for citizenship education research and practice.

T1  - Thermal Performance of LSF Wall Systems with Vacuum Insulation Panels
AN  - 2612751276
AB  - Lightweight Steel Frames (LSF) in building construction are becoming more popular due to their fast, clean, and flexible constructability. Typical LSF wall panels are made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel lipped channel studs with plasterboard linings. Due to the high thermal conductivity of steel, these LSF components must be well engineered and covered against unintended thermal bridges. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the heat transfer of the LSF wall of different configurations and reduce heat loss through walls by lowering the thermal transmittance, which would ultimately minimise the energy consumption in buildings. The effect of novel thermal insulation material, Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIP), their position on the LSF wall configuration, and Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and plasterboard’s effect on the thermal transmittance of LSF walls were investigated through numerical analysis. A total of 56 wall configurations and 112 finite element models were analysed and compared with the minimum U-value requirements of UK building regulations. Numerical model results exhibited that using plasterboards instead of OSB has no considerable effect on the U-value of the LSF walls. However, 77% (4 times) of U-value reduction was exhibited by introducing the 20 mm VIP. Moreover, the position of the VIP to the U-value of LSF was negligible. Based on the results, optimum LSF wall configurations were proposed by highlighting the construction methods. Additionally, this study, through literature, seeks to identify other areas in which additional research can be conducted to achieve the desired thermal efficiency of buildings using LSF wall systems.

T1  - Effect of Climate Change on Introduced and Native Agricultural Invasive Insect Pests in Europe
AN  - 2602099235
AB  - Simple SummaryInvasive insects, along with climate change, are among the two most important environmental problems facing the world today. They pose a threat to many ecosystems worldwide, especially agriculture. As a result, there is a serious risk of economic losses to crops and a challenge to human food security. The aim of this review is to examine the relationship between climate change and the process of invasion of economically important insects in Europe. In recent decades, globalization has led to an increase in the worldwide movement of people and goods, resulting in an increase in the number of insects introduced into areas outside their original range. The harmful effects of invasive insects may be exacerbated by climate change as barriers to their successful establishment and dispersal decrease. To limit economic and environmental damage, it is important to understand the biotic and abiotic factors that influence the process of insect invasion in the context of climate change. We highlight the main biotic factors that influence the biological invasion process. Finally, we present the adaptive management strategies for invasion of non-native insect pests’ invasion that include prevention, eradication and assessment of biological invasion in the form of predictive modelling.AbstractClimate change and invasive species are major environmental issues facing the world today. They represent the major threats for various types of ecosystems worldwide, mainly managed ecosystems such as agriculture. This study aims to examine the link between climate change and the biological invasion of insect pest species. Increased international trade systems and human mobility have led to increasing introduction rates of invasive insects while climate change could decrease barriers for their establishment and distribution. To mitigate environmental and economic damage it is important to understand the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the process of invasion (transport, introduction, establishment, and dispersal) in terms of climate change. We highlight the major biotic factors affecting the biological invasion process: diet breadth, phenological plasticity, and lifecycle strategies. Finally, we present alien insect pest invasion management that includes prevention, eradication, and assessment of the biological invasion in the form of modelling prediction tools.

T1  - Enhancing the Visibility of SuDS in Strategic Planning Using Preliminary Regional Opportunity Screening
AN  - 2602093657
AB  - Surface water flooding poses significant threats to communities and environments. This threat has historically been managed through sewers and combined sewer overflows; however, it is now well recognised that, alone, these legacy systems are insufficient to manage the growing pressures from climate change, population growth and urbanisation. This realisation has led to research and practice developing a broad range of new technologies to enhance the coping capacities of existing sewer systems through capturing and attenuating or reusing surface water across catchments using sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). However, despite technical understanding, industry champions and significant best practice, SuDS remain underutilised, particularly at a synergistic catchment scale where they can be most effective. In this paper we respond to this challenge by developing preliminary screening tools to enhance the visibility of SuDS among the multidisciplinary decision-makers responsible for directing strategic surface water management. We achieve this through upscaling a regional decision support model and demonstrating implementation across a case study in South West England. We find that it is possible to use easily accessible and open-source data to provide initial indications of SuDS opportunities and that this early visibility in the decision-making process can be used to support the consideration of novel and effective surface water management strategies.

T1  - Performance Analysis of the Developed Air Source Heat Pump System at Low-to-Medium and High Supply Temperatures for Irish Housing Stock Heat Load Applications
AN  - 2596062719
AB  - Decarbonization of the UK residential heating sector is crucial to cut the carbon emissions and meet the legal binding of the Climate Change Act, 2008. The current progress with residential building sector carbon neutrality is slow and, hence, acceleration in action is required. The heat pump (HP) technology was found to be a potential candidate for sustainable development instead of fossil fuel-based oil/gas boilers, but improvement in its coefficient of performance (COP) is essential to compete with the lower gas/oil unit energy cost. The number of studies found in the literature were very limited, with the customized prototype development in the context of Northern Ireland, but without considering the simultaneous impact of heat supply temperature and operating mode of control for performance improvement in different property types. It is evidenced in the literature that the variable speed capacity control approach could improve the annual performance, but the literature has not looked into the compressor efficiencies challenges. In this study, steady state testing with a range of fixed constant heat loads (3–18 KW), done by varying compressor speed and its impact on COP, compressor efficiencies, and inverter losses, was established. The HP performance was measured and evaluated at low (35 °C)-to-medium (45 °C) and high (55 °C) heat supply temperature levels under the controlled laboratory conditions over the experienced ambient temperature. According to the result the COP values varies according to heat supply temperature, ambient temperature conditions, and heating capacity. The HP annual performances with Irish housing stock were evaluated in two modes of control and three case studies (C1, C2, C3) based on the experimentally validated model. The heat load demand in five property types with four age periods were considered in the analysis. The system could meet the required heat load demand for all property types in VSM with different percentage improvements in performance in comparison to FSM depending on the considered case level of the heat supply temperature (C1, C2, C3).

T1  - Understanding the Market for Eco Self-Build Community Housing
AN  - 2596060351
AB  - This paper evaluates the potential of eco self-build community (ESBC) housing to act as a socially and environmentally sustainable housing solution that can address the demand for self-build and community housing whilst supporting the UK’s 2050 net-zero-carbon commitment. This model of housing is being piloted through schemes such as the Water Lilies project, an upcoming ESBC scheme providing self-finish houses and custom-build flats. The research aims to gain a broad understanding of the market for ESBC housing by analysing the data from people who registered interest in a plot or home and comparing this with data from a similar survey targeted at the market for conventional self-build and custom-build housing. The key findings are that: (1) the ESBC housing market is largely open to more than one build method, but with a greater preference for purchasing a completed home and self-finish than self-build, compared to the conventional market for self-build and custom-build that is primarily interested in self-build; (2) the ESBC housing market is looking for a variety of home sizes, though predominantly 2 and 3 bedrooms, that could be provided through houses and flats, compared to the conventional market for self-build and custom-build that is mostly seeking larger houses on single plots; (3) the most important housing aspects to the ESBC housing market are ‘green lifestyle’, ‘style and construction quality’, and ‘community spirit’, which differ to the conventional self-build and custom-build market, where they are ‘construction quality’, ‘internal appearance/layout’ and ‘location’; (4) living in a sustainable home is important to the market for conventional self-build and custom-build housing and on average, they would be willing to pay 27% more for a highly sustainable home than the average UK new build. The main drivers are that people want to reduce their environmental impact and reduce their home running costs. A key overall conclusion of the study is that a distinct market exists for ESBC schemes, where the priorities of prospective homeowners differ to those from the more general self-build market. For ESBC schemes, the provision of eco-housing and a sense of community are key priorities, whereas for the more general self-build market, location and the need to tailor the house design to the owner’s unique aesthetic and lifestyle preferences tend to be the most important factors. This paper discusses the implications of these findings and identifies opportunities for scaling up the delivery of ESBC housing.

T1  - Optimising Electrical Power Supply Sustainability Using a Grid-Connected Hybrid Renewable Energy System—An NHS Hospital Case Study
AN  - 2596032866
AB  - This study focuses on improving the sustainability of electrical supply in the healthcare system in the UK, to contribute to current efforts made towards the 2050 net-zero carbon target. As a case study, we propose a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a hospital in the south-east of England. Electrical consumption data were gathered from five wards in the hospital for a period of one year. PV-battery-grid system architecture was selected to ensure practical execution through the installation of PV arrays on the roof of the facility. Selection of the optimal system was conducted through a novel methodology combining multi-objective optimisation and data forecasting. The optimisation was conducted using a genetic algorithm with two objectives (1) minimisation of the levelised cost of energy and (2) CO2 emissions. Advanced data forecasting was used to forecast grid emissions and other cost parameters at two year intervals (2023 and 2025). Several optimisation simulations were carried out using the actual and forecasted parameters to improve decision making. The results show that incorporating forecasted parameters into the optimisation allows to identify the subset of optimal solutions that will become sub-optimal in the future and, therefore, should be avoided. Finally, a framework for choosing the most suitable subset of optimal solutions was presented.

T1  - Before/after intervention study to determine impact on life-cycle carbon footprint of converting from single-use to reusable sharps containers in 40 UK NHS trusts
AN  - 2593628673
AB  - ObjectivesTo compare global warming potential (GWP) of hospitals converting from single-use sharps containers to reusable sharps containers (SSC, RSC). Does conversion to RSC result in GWP reduction?DesignUsing BS PAS 2050:2011 principles, a retrospective, before/after intervention quantitative model together with a purpose-designed, attributional ‘cradle-to-grave’ life-cycle tool, were used to determine the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the two sharps containment systems. Functional unit was total fill line litres (FLL) of sharps containers needed to dispose of sharps for 1-year period in 40 trusts. Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions were included. Results were workload-normalised using National Health Service (NHS) national hospital patient-workload indicators. A sensitivity analysis examined areas of data variability.SettingAcute care hospital trusts in UK.Participants40 NHS hospital Trusts using RSC.InterventionConversion from SSC to RSC. SSC and RSC usage details in 17 base line trusts immediately prior to 2018 were applied to the RSC usage details of the 40 trusts using RSC in 2019.Primary outcome measureThe comparison of GWP calculated in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) generated in the manufacture, transport, service and disposal of 12 months, hospital-wide usage of both containment systems in the 40 trusts.ResultsThe 40 trusts converting to RSC reduced their combined annual GWP by 3267.4 tonnes CO2e (−83.9%); eliminated incineration of 900.8 tonnes of plastic; eliminated disposal/recycling of 132.5 tonnes of cardboard and reduced container exchanges by 61.1%. GHG as kg CO2e/1000 FLL were 313.0 and 50.7 for SSC and RSC systems, respectively. A sensitivity analysis showed substantial GHG reductions within unit processes could be achieved, however, their impact on relevant final GWP comparison varied <5% from base comparison.ConclusionsAdopting RSC is an example of a sustainable purchasing decision that can assist trusts meet NHS GHG reduction targets and can reduce GWP permanently with minimal staff behavioural change.

T1  - Application of Urban Scale Energy Modelling and Multi-Objective Optimization Techniques for Building Energy Renovation at District Scale
AN  - 2584699343
AB  - Nearly-zero energy buildings are now a standard for new constructions. However, the real challenge for a decarbonized society relies in the renovation of the existing building stock, selecting energy efficiency measures considering not only the energy performance but also the economic and sustainability ones. Even if the literature is full of examples coupling building energy simulation with multi-objective optimization for the identification of the best measures, the adoption of such approaches is still limited for district and urban scale simulation, often because of lack of complete data inputs and high computational requirements. In this research, a new methodology is proposed, combining the detailed geometric characterization of urban simulation tools with the simplification provided by “building archetype” modeling, in order to ensure the development of robust models for the multi-objective optimization of retrofit interventions at district scale. Using CitySim as an urban scale energy modeling tool, a residential district built in the 1990s in Bolzano, Italy, was studied. Different sets of renovation measures for the building envelope and three objectives —i.e., energy, economic and sustainability performances, were compared. Despite energy savings from 29 to 46%, energy efficiency measures applied just to the building envelope were found insufficient to meet the carbon neutrality goals without interventions to the system, in particular considering mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. Furthermore, public subsidization has been revealed to be necessary, since none of the proposed measures is able to pay back the initial investment for this case study.

T1  - Immature Insect Assemblages from the Early Cretaceous (Purbeck/Wealden) of Southern England
AN  - 2584632860
AB  - Simple SummaryThe non-marine Lower Cretaceous Purbeck and Wealden rocks of southern England provide an important record of insects that lived alongside the dinosaurs. Most fossil remains are those of adult insects from orders alive today, but immature insects and their trace fossils occur in the same deposits. Terrestrial immatures comprise mostly sessile nymphs of true bugs, whereas the aquatic immature fauna is represented by stoneflies and mayflies (rarely), dragonflies (uncommonly), true bugs and true flies (often common in the Purbeck), and the cases of caddisflies (locally common in the Wealden). These fossils help to shed light on the local palaeoenvironment, such as the salinity of water bodies, as well as on the processes that lead to the fossilization of generally fragile insect remains.AbstractThe record of immature insects from the non-marine Purbeck and Wealden groups (Lower Cretaceous) of southern England is reviewed and expanded. Fossils of adult terrestrial insects are locally common, but terrestrial immature remains are restricted to transported hemipterans, most of which are sessile nymphs or puparia resembling those of extant whiteflies (Aleyrodidae). Remains of immature aquatic insects are more diverse and comprise the extant orders Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Trichoptera, Hemiptera and Diptera. The Trichoptera are represented by larval cases constructed from a variety of materials corresponding to several ichnogenera. The Wealden immature insects were preserved in predominantly freshwater fluvial settings, whereas the Purbeck ones occur in lagoonal palaeoenvironments, ranging in salinity from brackish to hypersaline. The composition of aquatic immature insect faunas in the latter offers potential for palaeosalinity analysis, although there are complicating factors relating to habitat stability. Uncommon trace fossils such as beetle borings in wood provide evidence of immature insects not represented by body fossils.

T1  - The Scope of Climate Assemblies: Lessons from the Climate Assembly UK
AN  - 2584534255
AB  - In recent times we have seen a spate of climate assemblies across Europe as the climate emergency gains increasing prominence in the political agenda and as the citizens’ assembly approach to public engagement gains popularity. However, there has been little empirical research on how the scope of citizens’ assemblies affects the internal logic of the assembly process and its impacts on external policy actors. This is a significant oversight given the power of agenda setting. It is also of particular importance for climate assemblies given the exceptional scale and complexity of climate change, as well as the need for co-ordination across all policy areas and types of governance to address it. In this paper, we start to address this gap through an in-depth case analysis of the Climate Assembly UK. We adopt a mixed methods approach, combining surveys of the assembly members and witnesses, interviews with the assembly members, organisers, MPs, parliamentary staff, and government civil servants, and non-participant observation of the process. We find that attempts to adapt the assembly’s scope to the scale of the climate change issue compromised assembly member learning, the co-ordination of the resulting recommendations, assembly member endorsement of the recommendations, and the extent of their impact on parliament and government. We argue that more democratization in setting the agenda could help combat these issues.

T1  - Environmental Sustainability Assessment of Pig Farms in Selected European Countries: Combining LCA and Key Performance Indicators for Biodiversity Assessment
AN  - 2584512626
AB  - The aim of this study was to combine Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) assessment focusing on biodiversity in order to examine the environmental impacts of different pig farm types (13 breeding, 23 finishing and 27 breeding-to-finishing farms) in seven European countries. In addition, the relationship between environmental impacts and selected farm management characteristics was explored. Fossil energy depletion (FED), global warming (GWP), acidification (AP) as well as marine (MEP) and fresh water (FEP) eutrophication potential were assessed by an attributional LCA and expressed per kilogram body mass net sold (BMNS). In addition, the potential biodiversity performance of all crop-livestock farms within the sample (n = 56) was evaluated with a KPI assessment of biodiversity-related field management characteristics. We found no relationship between LCA results and biodiversity scores (KPI). LCA and biodiversity performance varied more within than across farm types (breeding, finishing, breeding-to-finishing). For example, the GWP expressed per kg BMNS of the breeding unit of breeding-to-finishing farms was on average (median) 2.77 (range: 1.40–4.78) and of breeding farms 2.57 (range: 1.91–3.23) kg CO2-eq. The average (median) biodiversity theme score for breeding farms was 51% (range: 36–70%), for breeding-to-finishing farms 38% (range: 30–68%) and for finishing farms 43% (range: 28–67%). Several farm management characteristics (e.g., FCR, productivity, proportion of solid manure) correlated with all/some LCA results. Biodiversity performance depended especially on KPIs related to ecological focus areas, fertiliser management and GMO crops. The large range regarding environmental performance in both LCA and KPI assessment across farm types indicates that farm-specific improvement measures should be implemented to enhance overall environmental sustainability on farm. In conclusion, combining LCA with KPI assessment provides a more comprehensive environmental impact assessment of pig farms.

T1  - Telecoupled Groundwaters: New Ways to Investigate Increasingly De-Localized Resources
AN  - 2584482850
AB  - Groundwater is essential for drinking water provision and food production while hosting unique biodiversity and delivering key ecosystem services. However, overexploitation and contamination are prevailing threats in many regions worldwide. Even integrated governance schemes like the European Union Water Framework Directive often fail to ensure good quality and quantity conditions of groundwater bodies. Contributing factors are knowledge gaps on groundwater characteristics, limited financial, staff and land resources, as well as policy incoherencies. In this paper, we go further and argue that current groundwater challenges cannot be understood when considering the local situation within hydrologic boundaries only. New long-distance processes are at stake—so called telecouplings—that transgress watershed and administrative boundaries and significantly influence the state of local groundwater bodies. We provide three literature-based examples of European groundwater systems that are impacted by telecouplings, and we show how research and solution perspectives may change when acknowledging the de-localization of groundwater(s). We elaborate on virtual water trade, remote water supply, and seasonal tourist flows that connect sending, receiving and spillover systems. These processes can induce groundwater depletion and contamination but may also help to conserve the resource. Our hypothesis calls for a new spatial paradigm to groundwater management and highlights the need for transdisciplinary research approaches as envisioned in socio-hydrogeology.

T1  - Palm Foliage as Pathways of Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae Fungi and Host of New Lasiodiplodia Species from Mexico
AN  - 2584441824
AB  - Tropical palm foliage is increasingly imported to satisfy the steady growing demand in European floristry. This palm foliage presumably carries along diverse fungi whose taxonomic and functional diversity have not been addressed so far. The present study investigated Botryosphaeriaceae fungi associated with the foliage of palm species Chamaedorea elegans, C. metallica, C. seifrizii, Dypsis lutescens and Lodoicea maldivica imported from Mexico. Five species were identified using combined morphological characterisation and multilocus phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, TEF-1α, TUB2 and RPB2. In addition to Endomelanconiopsis endophytica, Lasiodiplodia brasiliensis and L. euphorbicola, two new species, namely, L. lodoiceae sp. nov. and L. mexicanensis sp. nov, are proposed. Apart from E. endophytica, mostly known as endophyte, L. brasiliensis and L. euphorbicola are responsible for different rot diseases and the dieback of important tropical crop plants. In pathogenicity tests on the temperate pome fruits apple (Malus domestica) and pear (Pyrus communis), all six Botryosphaeriaceae species induced necrotic lesions at different degrees of severity, with highest the aggressiveness from L. euphorbicola and L. mexicanensis on apple and from L. mexicanensis on pear. The results indicate that tropical palm foliage can be a pathway of potentially pathogenic fungi that may give rise to concerns with regard to plant health in the destination countries.

T1  - Shattercane (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench Subsp. Drummondii) and Weedy Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)—Crop Wild Relatives (CWRs) as Weeds in Agriculture
AN  - 2584352127
AB  - Shattercane (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench subsp. drummondii) and weedy sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) are two examples of crop wild relatives (CWRs) that have become troublesome weeds in agriculture. Shattercane is a race belonging to a different subspecies than domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench subsp. bicolor). Weedy sunflower populations are natural hybrids between wild and domesticated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Both species have key weedy characteristics, such as early seed shattering and seed dormancy, which play an important role in their success as agricultural weeds. They are widely reported as important agricultural weeds in the United States and have invaded various agricultural areas in Europe. Shattercane is very competitive to sorghum, maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Weedy sunflower causes severe yield losses in sunflower, maize, soybean, pulse crops, and industrial crops. Herbicide resistance was confirmed in populations of both species. The simultaneous presence of crops and their wild relatives in the field leads to crop–wild gene flow. Hybrids are fertile and competitive. Hybridization between herbicide-tolerant crops and wild populations creates herbicide-resistant hybrid populations. Crop rotation, false seedbed, cover crops, and competitive crop genotypes can suppress shattercane and weedy sunflower. Preventative measures are essential to avoid their spread on new agricultural lands. The development of effective weed management strategies is also essential to prevent hybridization between sorghum, sunflower, and their wild relatives and to mitigate its consequences.

T1  - Simulation of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period using HadGEM3: experimental design and results from model–model and model–data comparison
AN  - 2582748269
AB  - Here we present the experimental design and results from a new mid-Pliocene simulation using the latest version of the UK's physical climate model, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, conducted under the auspices of CMIP6/PMIP4/PlioMIP2. Although two other palaeoclimate simulations have been recently run using this model, they both focused on more recent periods within the Quaternary, and therefore this is the first time this version of the UK model has been run this far back in time. The mid-Pliocene Warm Period, ∼3 Ma, is of particular interest because it represents a time period when the Earth was in equilibrium with CO2 concentrations roughly equivalent to those of today, providing a possible analogue for current and future climate change.The implementation of the Pliocene boundary conditions is firstly described in detail, based on the PRISM4 dataset, including CO2, ozone, orography, ice mask, lakes, vegetation fractions and vegetation functional types. These were incrementally added into the model, to change from a pre-industrial setup to a Pliocene setup.The results of the simulation are then presented, which are firstly compared with the model's pre-industrial simulation, secondly with previous versions of the same model and with available proxy data, and thirdly with all other models included in PlioMIP2. Firstly, the comparison with the pre-industrial simulation suggests that the Pliocene simulation is consistent with current understanding and existing work, showing warmer and wetter conditions, and with the greatest warming occurring over high-latitude and polar regions. The global mean surface air temperature anomaly at the end of the Pliocene simulation is 5.1 ∘C, which is the second highest of all models included in PlioMIP2 and is consistent with the fact that HadGEM3-GC31-LL has one of the highest Effective Climate Sensitivities of all CMIP6 models. Secondly, the comparison with previous generation models and with proxy data suggests a clear increase in global sea surface temperatures as the model has undergone development. Up to a certain level of warming, this results in a better agreement with available proxy data, and the “sweet spot” appears to be the previous CMIP5 generation of the model, HadGEM2-AO. The most recent simulation presented here, however, appears to show poorer agreement with the proxy data compared with HadGEM2 and may be overly sensitive to the Pliocene boundary conditions, resulting in a climate that is too warm. Thirdly, the comparison with other models from PlioMIP2 further supports this conclusion, with HadGEM3-GC31-LL being one of the warmest and wettest models in all of PlioMIP2, and if all the models are ordered according to agreement with proxy data, HadGEM3-GC31-LL ranks approximately halfway among them. A caveat to these results is the relatively short run length of the simulation, meaning the model is not in full equilibrium. Given the computational cost of the model it was not possible to run it for a longer period; a Gregory plot analysis indicates that had it been allowed to come to full equilibrium, the final global mean surface temperature could have been approximately 1.5 ∘C higher.

T1  - Domestic Retrofit Assessment of the Heat Pump System Considering the Impact of Heat Supply Temperature and Operating Mode of Control—A Case Study
AN  - 2581073866
AB  - In this study, performance assessment of the variable speed compressor-based air source heat pump (ASHP) system as a domestic retrofit technology instead of fossil fuel-based heating technologies for the 1900s Mid terraced house is investigated. The assessment was conducted considering operating mode of control and heat supply temperature impact of the system. In the literature, ASHP system experimental development with variable speed mode (VSM) of control in comparison to fixed speed mode (FSM) of control at low to medium and high heat supply temperature in the context of UK was found with very limited number of studies, but without considering retrofit application. The focus of the earlier studies was on the individual components and performance improvement. The designed heat pump (HP), developed, and tested at constant heat load, simulating the real domestic heat demand under the controlled laboratory conditions and numerical modeling is utilized for the analysis purposes. The HP performance, energy demand, carbon emissions, and cost varies significantly due to changing heat supply temperature (35 °C, 45 °C, and 55 °C), control mode and accordingly the carbon emission and cost savings are achieved. The oil and gas boilers ranges from conventional to highly efficient type and evaluated in terms of annual running cost, energy consumptions, and carbon emissions in comparison with the HP system. Additionally, a comparative study with the existing retrofitted very high temperature ASHP inside the house is conducted. The developed HP at 55 °C could not defeat the very high heat supply temperature HP system (75 °C supply temperature) in performance and cost savings but become attractive at low supply temperature (35 °C). The HP system in VSM at low heat supply temperature instead of gas boiler (90% efficiency) could cut the annual carbon emissions by 59% but with additional 6% running cost for the Mid terraced test house in Belfast climatic conditions.

T1  - Carbon Management in UK Higher Education Institutions: An Overview
AN  - 2581068317
AB  - The paper presents a review of carbon management in relation to UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), forms part of a wider study on the ongoing reliance on fossil fuels in Scotland’s public sector with a focus on Universities and Local Government Authorities. It compares the CF (carbon footprint), emission sources, and the fossil fuel contribution to the CFs reported in 3 identified articles relating specifically to the estimation of CF for HEIs. The consumption of fossil fuels results in human induced climate change however, fossil fuels boosted the industrialization process and remains the dominant source of global energy consumption. Action in tackling climate change has led to organizations coming under increasing pressures to monitor and report their CFs. HEIs have a key role to play in reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions through delivery of scientific research and innovative carbon management solutions, increase in its uptake of renewable energy technologies, educating and training future leaders, and raising public awareness, in contribution to a sustainable society. This paper highlights the need for a shift of focus to reducing fossil fuel reliance in response to climate change and demonstrates how HEIs can impact GHG reductions.

T1  - Changes in Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources in the European Union Countries in 2005–2019
AN  - 2581005584
AB  - The policy related to the use of renewable sources is a key element of the energy policy executed in the European Union (EU). One of the targets set for 2050 is to increase the share of electricity in energy consumption to 50%, and 80% of electricity is to be generated from low-carbon sources. In recent years, the EU economies have significantly modified their electricity production, which raises the question of the scale of these changes. The aim of the presented analysis is to assess changes in the use of renewable sources for electricity production in the EU countries in 2005–2019. Gini coefficient and k-mean are applied in the analysis. The conducted research shows that EU countries, in line with the energy policy assumptions, have both increased the share of renewable sources in energy production, especially in electricity production, as well as increased the diversity of used renewable sources. The results also indicate a vast diversity in terms of the use of such sources for the production of renewable electricity in the EU. This indicates that the energy transition is being implemented by EU countries with individual country-level approaches. Nonetheless, a variety of the EU’s both support and restrictive measures are of considerable importance for the ongoing energy transition.

T1  - The Transition to Clean Energy: Are People Living in Island Communities Ready for Smart Grids and Demand Response?
AN  - 2580985544
AB  - Islands are widely recognised as ideal pilot sites that can spearhead the transition to clean energy and development towards a sustainable and healthy society. One of the assumptions underpinning this notion is that island communities are more ready to engage with smart grids (SGs) than people on the mainland. This is believed to be due to the high costs of energy on islands and the idea that the sense of community and collective action is stronger on islands than on the mainland. This paper presents findings from a survey conducted to assess people’s perception of, and readiness to engage with, SG and demand response (DR) in the communities of three islands taking part in a H2020 project called REACT. The main objective of the survey, conducted in 2020, was to inform the recruitment of participants in the project, which is piloting different technologies required for SGs and DR with communities on the three islands. The results show that many island residents are motivated to take part in SG, to engage with energy saving, and are willing to change some energy-related behaviours in their homes. However, the results also indicate that levels of ownership of, and knowledge and familiarity with, the SG and DR related technologies are extremely low, suggesting that the expected uptake of DR in islands might not be as high as anticipated. This brings into question the readiness of island dwellers for the SG, their role in the deployment of such schemes more widely and the validity of the assumptions often made about island communities. This has significant implications for the design of SGs and DR solutions for islands, including devoting sufficient efforts to build knowledge and awareness of the SG, investing in demonstration projects for that purpose and tailoring interventions based on island communities’ motivations.

An existing wind energy system for a large commercial factory in the rural area of Barnard Castle, United Kingdom (UK) is nearing the end of its usable life. The existing system is operating at 8 % load factor, providing only 5 % of the site annual load. A techno-economic assessment of three renewable energy proposals will ensure the site’s energy strategy is successful. Three proposals were examined, to continue with the current system until failure, to overhaul the current system and prolong its usable life, or to replace the wind turbines with a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system. The Net Present Value, Payback Period, Levelised Cost of Electricity and the equivalent Carbon Dioxide emissions were compared for each alternative. The photovoltaic system was the unanimous choice. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to systematically select the most appropriate PV module technology for the proposed system, based on the most important factors. Seven different PV module variants were selected and given weighted ratings to determine the most suitable model, the outcome of this was the SunPower SPR-MAX2 360 model. This decision was verified by the Consistency Ratio which indicated an informed decision had been made.

T1  - The heat recovery potential of ‘wastewater’: a national analysis of sewage effluent discharge temperatures
AN  - 2577663383
AB  - Final sewage effluent (FSE) is typically warmer than the rivers it is often discharged to. The excess heat energy could be recovered and utilised to help meet climate change targets. Using data from England for 2000–2019, we show that FSE temperatures were on average 2.2 °C higher than river temperatures, with a corresponding annual heat recovery potential of ∼18.3 TW h which could meet ∼3.6% of the UK's heat demand. Crude sewage temperatures were on average 1.5 °C higher that FSE temperatures, implying that a further ∼12.5 TW h is lost annually during treatment prior to discharge. The largest temperature differences between FSE and rivers, and crude sewage and FSE, occurred during the autumn and winter months, meaning that the greatest seasonal heat recovery potential coincides with the greatest heat demand. The temperature difference between FSE and rivers increased at an average rate of ∼0.03 °C per year from 2000 to 2019. Therefore, and in addition to predicted population growth, wastewater heat is a growing resource. The largest temperature differences between FSE and rivers would generally be expected to occur in northeast England. However, FSE discharges with sufficiently large temperature differences between FSE and rivers were demonstrated to exist across England and were not restricted to one region or water company. Wastewater treatment works discharge effluent continuously and occur nearby to domestic settlements, which account for the majority of the UK's heat demand. Therefore, there is clear local potential to recover heat and meet national emissions targets whilst further reducing environmental impact on rivers.

T1  - Scenarios, Financial Viability and Pathways of Localized Hybrid Energy Generation Systems around the United Kingdom
AN  - 2576397338
AB  - Decarbonisation is becoming a central aim of countries around the globe, ensuring the effects of climate change do not increase exponentially in the coming years. Renewable energy generation is at the core of this decarbonisation process, enabling economies to divorce themselves from a reliance on oil and coal. Hybrid energy systems can utilise multiple generation methods to supply electrical demand best. This paper investigates the use of localised hybrid energy systems around the UK, comparing the financial viability of solar, wind and hydrokinetic generation methods both as a hybrid system and individually in different scenarios. The significance of having localised hybrid energy systems is that they address two large problems within renewable energy generation, that of storage issues and also generating the electricity far away from where it is actually used, requiring extensive infrastructure. The microgrid optimisation software HOMER was used to simulate each of the generation methods alongside the national grid, including lithium ion batteries and converters to create a comprehensive hybrid system. Net Present Cost, which is the current value of all the costs of installing and operating the system over the project lifetime, was considered as the metric. The analysis finds that for each modelled location, wind turbines in combination with lithium ion batteries and a converter is the system with the lowest Net Present Cost, with the exception of Bristol, which also uses hydrokinetic turbines within the system. The findings indicate the extensive wind resources available within the UK, along with identifying that certain locations around the country also have very high potential for tidal power generation.

T1  - Thoughts on the Future of Higher Education in the UK: A Personal View with a Historical Context
AN  - 2576393259
AB  - Before the effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic, there had been continued debate about the future of Higher Education (HE) in the UK. It is now accepted that the effect of the pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on HE in the UK and elsewhere. This paper addresses the changes that are currently taking place, based on a strategy that aims to develop a future knowledge-based economy, following the UK governments 2019 landmark review of HE. It explores the underlying parallels between the current situation and certain historical events that catalysed the development of a new approach to HE in the past, which is very relevant today. In this context, the paper discusses why major changes in UK HE provision is now required as a response to the fact that although the cost of education is rising, employers are reporting that graduates are increasingly unprepared for the workplace. In this respect, the paper addresses a model for HE that focuses on `earn-as-you-learn’ apprenticeships and work-place-based learning. The key to this is the emphasis that the UK government is now placing on funding new `Technological Colleges’, in which students are trained by experts from the industry on a contractual basis, rather than by university academics with tenured positions.

T1  - Towards Net Zero Carbon Economy: Improving the Sustainability of Existing Industrial Infrastructures in the UK
AN  - 2576391255
AB  - To comply with the new net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) target set by the United Kingdom government by 2050, different sectors including the industrial sector are required to take action to achieve this target. Improving the building envelope and production of clean energy on site are among the activities that should be considered by businesses to reduce their carbon emissions. This research analysis the current energy performance and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of an industrial building in Liverpool, UK utilizing the Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IESVE) software modeling. Then it has proposed some methods for improving the current performance and reduce the carbon footprint of the building. The results indicated that the installation of wall and floor insulation could decrease the energy usage and CO2 emissions of the building by about 56.39%. Additionally, the production of clean energy on site using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels could reduce the annual CO2 emissions by up to 16%. Furthermore, this research provided some figures about offsetting the rest of CO2 emissions using different international offsetting schemes to achieve carbon neutrality of the building.

T1  - Integration and Analysis of Multi-Modal Geospatial Secondary Data to Inform Management of at-Risk Archaeological Sites
AN  - 2576390192
AB  - Climate change poses an imminent physical risk to cultural heritage sites and their surrounding landscape through intensifying environmental processes such as damaging wetting and drying cycles that disrupt archaeological preservation conditions, and soil erosion which threatens to expose deposits and alter the archaeological context of sites. In the face of such threats, geospatial techniques such as GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modelling have proved invaluable tools for archaeological research and cultural heritage monitoring. This paper presents the application of secondary multi-source and multi-temporal geospatial data within a processing framework to provide a comprehensive assessment of geophysical risk to the Roman fort of Magna, Carvoran, UK. An investigation into the ancient hydraulic system at Magna was carried out with analysis of vegetation change over time, and spatio-temporal analysis of soil erosion risk at the site. Due to COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time of this study, these analyses were conducted using only secondary data with the aim to guide further archaeological research, and management and monitoring strategies for the stakeholders involved. Results guided inferences about the ancient hydraulic system, providing insights regarding how to better manage the site at Magna in the future. Analysis of soil erosion allowed the identification of hot spot areas, indicating a future increase in rates of erosion at Magna and suggesting a seasonal period of higher risk of degradation to the site. Results have proven that freely available multi-purpose national-scale datasets are sufficient to create meaningful insights into archaeological sites where physical access to the site is inhibited. This infers the potential to carry out preliminary risk assessment to inform future site management practices.

T1  - Community interventions for improving adult mental health: mapping local policy and practice in England
AN  - 2574441544
AB  - Background 
Public mental health (PMH) aims to improve wellbeing and prevent poor mental health at the population level. It is a global challenge and a UK priority area for action. Communities play an important role in the provision of PMH interventions. However, the evidence base concerning community-based PMH interventions is limited, meaning it is challenging to compare service provision to need. Without this, the efficient and equitable provision of services is hindered. Here, we sought to map the current range of community-based interventions for improving mental health and wellbeing currently provided in England to inform priority areas for policy and service intervention.
 Method 
We adopted an established mapping exercise methodology, comparing service provision with demographic and deprivation statistics. Five local authority areas of England were selected based on differing demographics, mental health needs and wider challenging circumstances (i.e. high deprivation). Community-based interventions were identified through: 1) desk-based research 2) established professional networks 3) chain-referral sampling of individuals involved in local mental health promotion and prevention and 4) peer researchers’ insight. We included all community-based, non-clinical interventions aimed at adult residents operating between July 2019 and May 2020.
 Results 
407 interventions were identified across the five areas addressing 16 risk/protective factors for PMH. Interventions for social isolation and loneliness were most prevalent, most commonly through social activities and/or befriending services. The most common subpopulations targeted were older adults and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. Interventions focusing on broader structural and environmental determinants were uncommon. There was some evidence of service provision being tailored to local need, though this was inconsistent, meaning some at-risk groups such as men or LGBTQ+ people from minority ethnic backgrounds were missed. Interventions were not consistently evaluated.
 Conclusions 
There was evidence of partial responsiveness to national and local prioritising. Provision was geared mainly towards addressing social and individual determinants of PMH, suggesting more integration is needed to engage wider service providers and policy-makers in PMH strategy and delivery at the community level. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of services to improve PMH needs to be urgently addressed to determine the extent of their effectiveness in communities they serve.

T1  - The Road to Net Zero: A Case Study of Innovative Technologies and Policy Changes Used at a Medium-Sized University to Achieve Czero by 2030
AN  - 2571539400
AB  - The need for the world to follow a more carbon-neutral path is clear, with growing evidence highlighting the existential threat posed by unregulated GHG emissions. Responsibility for achieving this does not only lie with policy makers but is shared with all stakeholders including governments, private sectors, charities and civil society as a whole. Several methodological approaches have been developed to set emission reduction targets, including the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). However, it is yet to be widely adopted, and as thought leaders in the field, universities must take a lead in its interpretation and application. This study is reported from the perspective of a UK university, which is adopting climate change considerations to facilitate achieving Czero by 2030 and will act as an exemplar case. We calculate baseline emissions, science-based reduction targets for different carbon emission reduction methods and options in terms of financing emission reduction pathways at present and in the future. The study outcomes show that incorporating a SBTi methodology can serve as insight into other medium-sized organisations and universities wishing to develop a net-zero pathway. These results have been summarised into a series of recommendations.

T1  - An In-Depth Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Lithium-Ion Battery for Climate Impact Mitigation Strategies
AN  - 2571061847
AB  - Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are an essential component of renewable electricity infrastructure to resolve the intermittency in the availability of renewable resources. To keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 °C, renewable electricity and electrification of the majority of the sectors are a key proposition of the national and international policies and strategies. Thus, the role of BESS in achieving the climate impact mitigation target is significant. There is an unmet need for a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of BESS with lithium-ion batteries being the most promising one. This study conducts a rigorous and comprehensive LCA of lithium-ion batteries to demonstrate the life cycle environmental impact hotspots and ways to improve the hotspots for the sustainable development of BESS and thus, renewable electricity infrastructure. The whole system LCA of lithium-ion batteries shows a global warming potential (GWP) of 1.7, 6.7 and 8.1 kg CO2 eq kg−1 in change-oriented (consequential) and present with and without recycling credit consideration, scenarios. The GWP hotspot is the lithium-ion cathode, which is due to lithium hexafluorophosphate that is ultimately due to the resource-intensive production system of phosphorous, white, liquid. To compete against the fossil economy, the GWP of BESS must be curbed by 13 folds. To be comparable with renewable energy systems, hydroelectric, wind, biomass, geothermal and solar (4–76 g CO2 eq kWh−1), 300 folds reduction in the GWP of BESS will be necessary. The areas of improvement to lower the GWP of BESS are as follows: reducing scopes 2–3 emissions from fossil resource use in the material production processes by phosphorous recycling, increasing energy density, increasing lifespan by effective services, increasing recyclability and number of lives, waste resource acquisition for the battery components and deploying multi-faceted integrated roles of BESS. Achieving the above can be translated into an overall avoided GWP of up to 82% by 2040.

T1  - Is Green Recovery Enough? Analysing the Impacts of Post-COVID-19 Economic Packages
AN  - 2571061004
AB  - Emissions pathways after COVID-19 will be shaped by how governments’ economic responses translate into infrastructure expansion, energy use, investment planning and societal changes. As a response to the COVID-19 crisis, most governments worldwide launched recovery packages aiming to boost their economies, support employment and enhance their competitiveness. Climate action is pledged to be embedded in most of these packages, but with sharp differences across countries. This paper provides novel evidence on the energy system and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions implications of post-COVID-19 recovery packages by assessing the gap between pledged recovery packages and the actual investment needs of the energy transition to reach the Paris Agreement goals. Using two well-established Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and analysing various scenarios combining recovery packages and climate policies, we conclude that currently planned recovery from COVID-19 is not enough to enhance societal responses to climate urgency and that it should be significantly upscaled and prolonged to ensure compatibility with the Paris Agreement goals.

T1  - Emulating computer experiments of transport infrastructure slope stability using Gaussian processes and Bayesian inference
AN  - 2569331660
AB  - We propose using fully Bayesian Gaussian process emulation (GPE) as a surrogate for expensive computer experiments of transport infrastructure cut slopes in high-plasticity clay soils that are associated with an increased risk of failure. Our deterioration experiments simulate the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and seasonal pore water pressure cycles to determine slope failure time. It is impractical to perform the number of computer simulations that would be sufficient to make slope stability predictions over a meaningful range of geometries and strength parameters. Therefore, a GPE is used as an interpolator over a set of optimally spaced simulator runs modeling the time to slope failure as a function of geometry, strength, and permeability. Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation are used to obtain posterior estimates of the GPE parameters. For the experiments that do not reach failure within model time of 184 years, the time to failure is stochastically imputed by the Bayesian model. The trained GPE has the potential to inform infrastructure slope design, management, and maintenance. The reduction in computational cost compared with the original simulator makes it a highly attractive tool which can be applied to the different spatio-temporal scales of transport networks.

T1  - A Feasibility Study to Reduce Infrasound Emissions from Existing Wind Turbine Blades Using a Biomimetic Technique
AN  - 2565225854
AB  - Infrasound, i.e., low-frequency noise in the frequency range of 10–200 Hz, produced by rotating wind turbine blades has become a matter of concern because it is harmful to human health. Today, with the rapid increase of wind turbine size, this kind of noise is more worrying than ever. Although much effort has been made to design quiet wind turbine blades, today there is still a lack of effective techniques to reduce infrasound emissions from existing blades. To fill this gap in technology, a biomimetic technique that can be readily applied to reduce infrasound emissions of existing wind turbine blades is studied in this paper using both numerical simulation and experimental testing approaches. The numerical study of the technique is based on the analysis of the sound field distribution near the blade, which is derived by performing both aerodynamic and acoustic simulations of the blade. The experimental study of the technique is based on laboratory tests of two scale models of the blade. Both numerical and experimental studies have shown that the shedding vortices behind the blade can be successfully suppressed by semi-cylindrical rings wrapped on the blade. Consequently, both infrasound and the overall sound pressure level of the noise produced by the blade are significantly reduced. Although the rings fail to show good performance in reducing high-frequency noise, it is not a problem for human health because high-frequency noise is weak and moreover it attenuates rapidly as distance increases. The research also showed that the proposed technique can, not only reduce the infrasound produced by the blade, but can also improve the power coefficient of wind turbines.

T1  - Economic and Carbon Costs of Electricity Balancing Services: The Need for Secure Flexible Low-Carbon Generation
AN  - 2565223363
AB  - The electricity sector aims to achieve a balanced progress in all three dimensions of the energy trilemma: affordability, decarbonisation and security of supply. Separate strategies for decarbonisation and security of supply have been pursued; each with close attention to minimising costs, thus consistent with the affordability aspect of the trilemma. However, while it is evident that the pathway for decarbonisation increases pressure on security of supply, the pressures that cost-minimising security of supply measures are putting on decarbonisation goes unaddressed. The United Kingdom (UK) is a global leader in the transition towards a decarbonised economy and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. As a major part of the UK, Great Britain (GB) has achieved greater than 50% of low-carbon electricity generation and the grid’s carbon intensity has dropped by 36% over the period 2015–2019. However, balancing services that provide security of supply uses only 8% of low-carbon generation. Their carbon intensity is double the grid’s average and this gap is widening. This is an effect of a systemic reliance on carbon-intensive fuels. Financial support for capital investment for flexible low-carbon technologies is much needed. The GB context suggests that an integrated strategy covering all three dimensions of the trilemma might achieve an improved balance between them and unlock an affordable, net-zero emissions and secure power system.

T1  - Modernist Projects of Community-Based Urban Farms in Residential Areas—A Review of Agrarian Cooperatives in the Context of Contemporary Urban Development
AN  - 2564722556
AB  - This paper concerns the issue of food systems in the context of urban development. It describes relevant residential area ideas that integrate cities with food production, such as agrarian cooperatives. In the first section, modernist projects of residential areas linked with urban farms are reviewed, considering cooperative movement and the Industrial Revolution. This review shows that the aim of these historical projects was self-sufficiency and sustainability, based on local food production and broad areas covered by vegetation. They are considered to be a contemporary residential model. The second part of the paper discusses contemporary projects of farms within estates. The study demonstrates that the production of goods under urban agriculture goes beyond private goods, such as food produced for market or own use. The examples discussed show that urban farming performs key functions in residential architecture.

AB  - Onwurah explains that the industrial past and their green future are not incompatible. A bold and ambitious Green Industrial Revolution will allow regions of Britain like the North East to lead the way in tackling the climate crisis. The Green Industrial Revolution is an amazing opportunity for Newcastle England. Onwurah argues that they can create thousands of new high skilled and well-paid jobs, and whole new industries, by the bank of the Tyne. They have to cut emissions, but this is not the burden that the Tories make it out to be. It is the chance of a lifetime, to make the real changes that will give working people healthier and happier lives, and enable us to take control of our future.

T1  - Urban Planning and European Innovation Policy: Achieving Sustainability, Social Inclusion, and Economic Growth?
AN  - 2562203771
AB  - Innovation has become a guiding principle for European Union policy. Funding schemes, research, and planning across all Member States are expected to be innovative. This article provides a critical analysis of the drivers and effects of this evolution. While positive results have been achieved due to innovation policies, this article proposes that taking a wider critical perspective reveals important caveats. The article zooms in on the EU’s innovation policies by analysing policy documents, projects funded, and on-the-ground impact on three citizen initiatives. The analysis asks whether and how the EU’s self-set goals of sustainability, social inclusion, and economic growth are approached and met in them. The findings suggest a problematic funnelling process. First, an emphasis on innovation is created with the objective of systematically unblocking resistance to the development and implementation of novelties in the name of competitiveness, job creation, and economic growth. Second, the idea of innovation is very loosely defined, while, when translated into urban planning, it is interpreted narrowly in terms of efficiency and behavioural change, digitalization, and smart technologies. As a result, (narrowly defined) innovation-led economic growth begins to supersede alternative values and visions for the future of European cities and regions. This can represent a problem for EU Member States as it creates a very limited, risk-based, and divisive direction of development. To contribute to the (re-)establishment of alternatives, this article finally offers policy recommendations primarily concerned with the reinstatement of the public interest beyond innovation-centred planning perspectives.

T1  - Sustainability in Heritage Buildings: Can We Improve the Sustainable Development of Existing Buildings under Approved Document L?
AN  - 2562195756
AB  - The British government has ambitions to achieve net-zero carbon emissions countrywide by 2050, with their largest challenge being emissions from the construction industry. Approved Document L sets standards for the fabric performance of buildings to regulate their consumption of fuel and power, thereby allowing easier transition to all-renewable grid electricity and the phasing out of fossil fuels. Whilst this approach has shown success in new builds, its effectiveness on retrofits, especially regarding built heritage, is significantly reduced. Responding to this, the paper investigates alternative sustainable design solutions that could feasibly justify revisions to Approved Document L, to improve the sustainable performance of existing buildings and bring them in line the government’s 2050 targets. Trialing solutions on a listed building case study, benchmark figures are used to analyse the energy, carbon, and cost implications of sustainable design approaches relating to passive design, low-carbon technologies, renewable energy, and additional considerations. Using this method, it is reasonable to conclude that the standards of Approved Document L for existing buildings are currently underperforming but can feasibly be revised to encompass the full breadth of contemporary sustainable design solutions.

T1  - The feasibility of inter-basin water transfers to manage climate risk in England
AN  - 2561530425; IND607378093
AB  - Climate change, population growth, and environmental pressures, pose challenges for water resource management. Many countries, like the UK, are projected to experience regional variation in the risk of droughts. One solution is to use inter-basin transfer (IBT) schemes to move water from where it is abundant to where it is scarce. But what are the first steps in studying the feasibility of such schemes as a solution? How can we ensure an IBT brings more resilient water future under the rapidly changing climate and not have a detrimental impact elsewhere? This paper develops and demonstrates a framework for a preliminary climate impacts assessment for IBT schemes. The framework evaluates negative hydrological and ecological impacts of IBTs to the exporting basin. A hypothetical IBT scheme, delivering water from the northeast of England to London in the southeast, is tested. Three transfer scenarios are analysed under 100 future climate scenarios generated from the driest member of UK Climate Projection 2018 (UKCP18). The framework shows there would be no ecological harm for the exporting basin under any scenario. However, the hydrological risk is sensitive to the IBT operation. Constant and low flow operation of the IBT would lead to supply deficits of up to 60% in the exporting basin by the 2080 s. Transferring larger volumes, but only in winter months, allows the IBT to meet the projected water resource deficit in London whilst not increasing hydrological risks in the northeast – even under the driest UKCP18 climate scenario.

T1  - Ground motion baseline analysis of the Cheshire UK GeoEnergy Observatory
AN  - 2560484943
AB  - Subsurface geonergy can induce ground motion and seismicity, however a scarcity of observations usually obscures the mechanisms underpinning such behaviour. Here, we analyse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from ERS, ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 satellites for the period 1995–2017 and interpret ground deformation in the area of the planned Cheshire UK GeoEnergy Observatory ahead of facility contruction. Ground motion is dominated by the compaction of tidal flat deposits overlying two paleo-valleys, trending NNW–SSE. The western paleo-valley experienced faster subsidence rates in the period 1995–2007, whereas the eastern paleo-valley subsided faster in the period 2016–2017. The research highlights how baseline assessment can help differentiate natural variation from any anthropogenic effects associated with the growth of new subsurface technologies.

T1  - Climate Change Adaptation and Sectoral Policy Coherence in the Caribbean
AN  - 2558956494
AB  - Climate change is an existential threat to small island developing states. Policy coherence aims to create synergies and avoid conflicts between policies. Mainstreaming adaptation across multiple sectors and achieving greater coherence amongst policies is needed. The paper applies qualitative document analysis, content analysis, and expert interviews to examine the degree of coherence between climate-sensitive sector policies in framing climate change adaptation and the adaptation goals outlined in the national development plan and national climate change policies in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Grenada, and Saint Lucia. The results indicate that adaptation is not fully integrated into the water, agriculture, coastal zone, and forestry policies. For example, while adaptation was explicitly addressed in Saint Lucia’s water policy, it was not explicitly addressed in SVG’s and Grenada’s water policy. The results show that Saint Lucia has the highest coherence score (93.52) while St. Vincent and the Grenadines has the lowest (91.12). The optimal coherence score that can be possibly obtained is 147, which indicates partial coherence in adaptation mainstreaming in sectoral policies. Expert interviews highlighted problems such as institutional arrangements, a silo approach, funding mechanisms, and policy implementation. Using the knowledge provided by the experts, a seven-step process is proposed to practically achieve policy coherence and operationalize the policies.

This study evaluates a bioretention fill media comprising 100% recycled waste components. The fill media components come from multiple waste streams, quarry waste from the construction sector, crushed glass and green waste compost from domestic waste, and sugar-beet washings from the food processing sector. The hydraulically important physical characteristics of the recycled fill media were evaluated against reported literature examples of bioretention fill media, alongside UK and international guidance documentation. The particle size distribution of the recycled fill media was found to be unlike that seen in the literature and was also not compliant with the UK’s CIRIA ’The SuDS Manual’ guidance (d≥6 mm = 45% vs. 0% target). However, this did not result in any additional non-compliance, with laboratory-derived saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks=101 mm/h) and porosity (ϕ=44%) within recommended ranges (100≤Ks≤300 mm/h, ϕ>30%). SWMM was used to predict the performance of a bioretention system installed with the recycled fill media compared to UK guidance configured systems. It was found that the recycled fill media would have similar performance to a UK guidance compliant system, irrespective of its particle size distribution. Further work is required to validate the predicted performance of the recycled media.

T1  - Framing Electric Mobility for Urban Sustainability in a Circular Economy Context: An Overview of the Literature
AN  - 2554765242
AB  - The development of electro-mobility is one of the centerpieces of European country attempts to reduce carbon emissions and increase the quality of life in cities. The goals of reducing emissions from the transport sector and phasing out fossil-fueled vehicles in (urban) transport by 2050 present unrivaled opportunities to foster electro-mobility. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and provides a detailed analysis of the current development of electro-mobility in Europe, assessing social, economic, and environmental aspects under a circular economy (CE) context. It also examines the existing challenges and suggests ways of addressing them towards improving the environmental performance of electro-mobility and the urban quality of life. The paper argues that a narrow technology-only agenda in electro-mobility will be less successful without the imperative of the CE, including not just materials and resources but also energy, to unlock the medium-term co-benefits of de-carbonization of both the transport as well as the building and energy sectors. The paper critically reviews some of the anticipated future developments that may guide the growth of this rapidly growing field into a CE.

T1  - A High Resolution Spatiotemporal Urban Heat Load Model for GB
AN  - 2554504936
AB  - The decarbonisation of heating in the United Kingdom is likely to entail both the mass adoption of heat pumps and widespread development of district heating infrastructure. Estimation of the spatially disaggregated heat demand is needed for both electrical distribution network with electrified heating and for the development of district heating. The temporal variation of heat demand is important when considering the operation of district heating, thermal energy storage and electrical grid storage. The difference between the national and urban heat demands profiles will vary due to the type and occupancy of buildings leading to temporal variations which have not been widely surveyed. This paper develops a high-resolution spatiotemporal heat load model for Great Britain (GB: England, Scotland a Wales) by identifying the appropriate datasets, archetype segmentation and characterisation for the domestic and nondomestic building stock. This is applied to a thermal model and calibrated on the local scale using gas consumption statistics. The annual GB heat demand was in close agreement with other estimates and the peak demand was 219 GWth. The urban heat demand was found to have a lower peak to trough ratio than the average national demand profile. This will have important implications for the uptake of heating technologies and design of district heating.

T1  - Analysis of Sub-Daily Precipitation for the PannEx Region
AN  - 2554416549
AB  - The PannEx is a GEWEX-initiated, community driven research network in the Pannonian Basin. One of the main scientific issues to address in PannEx is the investigation of precipitation extremes. Meteorological Services in the PannEx area collected the hourly precipitation data and commonly used a computer program, which was developed in the INTENSE project, to produce a set of global hydro-climatic indices. Calculations are carried out on data aggregated 1-, 3- and 6-h intervals. Selected indices are analyzed in this paper to assess the general climatology of the short-term precipitation in the Pannonian basin. The following indices are illustrated on maps and graphs: the annual mean and maxima of 1-h, 3-h and 6-h sums, the count of 3-hr periods greater than 20 mm thresholds, the maximum length of wet hours, the timing of wettest hour and the 1-h precipitation intensity. The seasonal trends of the 1-h precipitation intensity were tested from 1998 to 2019. Analysis of sub-daily precipitation has been limited by the availability of data on a global or a regional scale. The international effort made in this work through collaboration in the PannEx initiative contributes to enlarging the data availability for regional and global analysis of sub-daily precipitation extremes.

AB  - The nature of the Cenomanian–Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event (CTOAE) and its δ13 C Excursion is considered in the light of (1) the stratigraphical framework in which the CTOAE developed in the European shelf seas, (2) conclusions that can be drawn from new detailed investigations of the Chalk succession at three locations in England, at Melton Ross and Flixton in the Northern Province where organic-rich ‘black bands’ are present, and at Dover in the Southern Province (part of the Anglo-Paris Basin) where they are absent, and (3) how these conclusion fit in with the present understanding of the CTOAE. The application of the cerium anomaly method (German and Elderfield 1990) at Dover, Melton Ross and Flixton has allowed the varying palaeoredox conditions in the Chalk Sea and its sediments to be related to the acid insoluble residues, organic carbon, δ18O (calcite), δ13C (calcite), δ13C (organic matter), Fe 2+ and Mn2+ (calcite), and P/TiO2 (acid insoluble residue). This has provided evidence that the initial stages of the δ13C Excursion in England were related to (1) a drop of sea level estimated at between 45 and 85 metres, (2) influxes of terrestrial silicate and organic detritus from adjacent continental sources and the reworking of exposed marine sediments, and (3) the presence of three cold water phases (named the Wood, Jefferies and Black) associated with the appearance of the cold-water pulse fauna during the Plenus Cold Event. Conditions in the water column and in the chalk sediment were different in the two areas. In the Northern Province, cerium-enriched waters and anoxic conditions were widespread; the δ13C pattern reflects the interplay between the development of anoxia in the water column and the preservation of terrestrial and marine organic matter in the black bands; here the CTOAE was short-lived (~0.25 Ma) lasting only the length of the Upper Cenomanian Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone. In the Southern Province, water conditions were oxic and the δ13C Excursion lasted to the top of the Lower Turonian Watinoceras devonense Zone, much longer (~1.05 Ma) than in the Northern Province. These differences are discussed with respect to (1) the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event (CTAE) hypothesis when the ocean-continent-atmosphere systems were linked, (2) limitations of chemostratigraphic global correlation, and (3) the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event Recovery (CTOAER), a new term to define the varying lengths of time it took different oceans and seas to recover once the linked ocean-continent-atmosphere system was over. The possibility is considered that glacio- eustasy (the glacial control hypothesis of Jeans et al. 1991) with the waxing and waning of polar ice sheets, in association with the degassing of large igneous provinces, may have set the scene for the development of the Cenomanian–Turonian Anoxic Event (CTAE).

T1  - Communities on a Threshold: Climate Action and Wellbeing Potentialities in Scotland
AN  - 2549703497
AB  - Community projects provide opportunities for their participants to collectively undertake climate action and simultaneously experience alternative concepts of wellbeing. However, we argue that community projects do so in ‘liminal’ ways—on the threshold of (unactualised) social change. We employed an ethnographic approach involving participant observation and qualitative interviews to investigate two community climate action projects in Scotland supported by the Climate Challenge Fund (CCF). We identify some of the outcomes and barriers of these projects in relation to promoting wellbeing through work, transport, participation and green spaces for food production, biodiversity and recreation. Projects’ achievements are contextualised in light of the urgent imperative to tackle climate change and against a background of social inequality. Liminal community projects are structurally constrained in their potential to create wider systemic changes. However, the projects’ potential to promote wellbeing among their participants can intersect with climate change mitigation when systemic and wide-ranging changes are adopted. These changes must involve a meaningful shift towards an economy that centres wellbeing, framed through principles of environmental justice and promoting social equity.

T1  - Bending the Clock: New Perspectives on Nineteenth-Century Ageing: A Roundtable Conversation
AN  - 2546989908
AB  - Over the past decade, several academic studies have taken nineteenth-century ageing as their topic, including Devoney Looser’s Women Writers and Old Age in Great Britain (2008), Karen Chase’s The Victorians and Old Age (2009), Kay Heath’s Aging by the Book (2009), and Alice Crossley’s special issue of Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies (2017). Following the publication of two significant new monographs — Andrea Charise’s The Aesthetics of Senescence (2020) and Jacob Jewusiak’s Aging, Duration, and the English Novel (2019) — the time is ripe for a synthesis of this dynamic cluster of scholarship, with special attention to where nineteenth-century perspectives on ageing is going, and ought to go, from here. Recorded in January 2020, this roundtable is a curated compilation of conversations with key scholars in the field: Devoney Looser (Arizona State University), David McAllister (Birkbeck, University of London), Ruth M. McAdams (Skidmore College), Jake Jewusiak (Newcastle University), and Travis Chi Wing Lau (Kenyon College). Edited by Andrea Charise, this roundtable assembles new perspectives on the present and future of nineteenth-century studies of age(ing), including: What’s next for age studies’ approaches to reading and teaching nineteenth-century texts? How might a better understanding of ‘old’ models inform our current day concerns with ageing populations and intergenerational discord? Can age studies research help make a case for the enduring role of the arts and humanities in a STEM-dominated culture? And how might attending to the old, ageing, and obsolete help address newly emergent global crises, including the rise of populism and climate change? Accessible in both audio format and textual transcription, this roundtable interview offers a timely resource for researchers, students, and a broader public interested in the literary present and futures of ageing and older age.

T1  - Aflatoxins: History, Significant Milestones, Recent Data on Their Toxicity and Ways to Mitigation
AN  - 2544939117
AB  - In the early 1960s the discovery of aflatoxins began when a total of 100,000 turkey poults died by hitherto unknown turkey “X” disease in England. The disease was associated with Brazilian groundnut meal affected by Aspergillus flavus. The toxin was named Aspergillus flavus toxin—aflatoxin. From the point of view of agriculture, aflatoxins show the utmost importance. Until now, a total of 20 aflatoxins have been described, with B1, B2, G1, and G2 aflatoxins being the most significant. Contamination by aflatoxins is a global health problem. Aflatoxins pose acutely toxic, teratogenic, immunosuppressive, carcinogenic, and teratogenic effects. Besides food insecurity and human health, aflatoxins affect humanity at different levels, such as social, economical, and political. Great emphasis is placed on aflatoxin mitigation using biocontrol methods. Thus, this review is focused on aflatoxins in terms of historical development, the principal milestones of aflatoxin research, and recent data on their toxicity and different ways of mitigation.

T1  - A Comparative Environmental Assessment of Heat Pumps and Gas Boilers towards a Circular Economy in the UK
AN  - 2539696897
AB  - This research compares the potential environmental impacts of heat pumps with gas boilers and scenario analysis through utilising the life cycle approach. The study analyses the current situation with the baseline model and assesses future applications with Circular Economy (CE), Resource Efficiency (RE) and Limited Growth (LG) scenarios. Then, hybrid applications of low-carbon technologies and different manufacturing scenarios are investigated according to baseline and CE scenarios. Our results show that the use and manufacturing phases are responsible for 74% and 14% of all environmental impacts on average as expected. Even though the electricity mix of the UK has decarbonised substantially during the last decade, heat pumps still have higher lifetime impacts than gas boilers in all environmental categories except climate change impact. The carbon intensity of heat pumps is much lower than gas boilers with 0.111 and 0.097 kg CO2e for air source heat pumps and ground source heat pumps, whereas the boiler stands as 0.241 kg CO2e. Future scenarios offer significant reductions in most of the impact categories. The CE scenario has the highest potential with a 44% reduction for heat pumps and 27% for gas boilers on average. RE and LG scenarios have smaller potential than the CE scenario, relatively. However, several categories expect an increase in future scenarios such as freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity and metal depletion categories. High deployment of offshore wind farms will have a negative impact on these categories; therefore, a comprehensive approach through a market introduction programme should be provided at the beginning before shifting from one technology to another. The 50% Hybrid scenario results expect a reduction of 24% and 20% on average for ASHP and GSHP, respectively, in the baseline model. The reduction is much lower in the CE scenario, with only a 2% decrease for both heat pumps because of the reduction in heat demand in the future. These results emphasise that even though the importance of the use phase is significant in the baseline model, the remaining phases will play an important role to achieve Net-Zero targets in the future.

T1  - Scottish Islands Interconnections: Modelling the Impacts on the UK Electricity Network of Geographically Diverse Wind and Marine Energy
AN  - 2539695384
AB  - To meet climate change goals, the decarbonisation of the UK electricity supply is crucial. Increased geographic diversity and resource use could help provide grid and market stability and reduce CO2 intensive balancing actions. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of geographic diversity and Scottish island renewable energy on the UK network. This has been done by using the energy market modelling software PLEXOS with results validated using data for 2017/18. The model considers spatial diversification and forecasting errors by modelling day-ahead and intra-day markets with nodes for each distribution network operator region and island group. It was concluded that Scottish island renewable capacity could have a stabilising effect on the variability of renewables in terms of electricity generated, prices and forecasting errors, from the timescale of the entire year down to hours. The ability of geographically diverse generators to receive a higher price for electricity generated was shown to decrease with increased island capacity. Instances of negative prices were reduced with supply diversity (wind and marine) but not geographic diversity. Day ahead errors showed most clearly the impact of diversity of supply, particularly given the predictability of tidal stream generation.

T1  - Association between Urban Greenspace and Health: A Systematic Review of Literature
AN  - 2532499055
AB  - The current review aimed to explore the association between urban greenspaces and health indicators. In particular, our aims were to analyze the association between publicly accessible urban greenspaces exposure and two selected health outcomes (objectively measured physical activity (PA) and mental health outcomes (MH)). Two electronic databases—PubMed/Medline and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE)—were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2020. Only articles in English were considered. Out of 356 retrieved articles, a total of 34 papers were included in our review. Of those, 15 assessed the association between urban greenspace and PA and 19 dealt with MH. Almost all the included studies found a positive association between urban greenspace and both PA and MH, while a few demonstrated a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes. However, only guaranteeing access is not enough. Indeed, important elements are maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, planning of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects. Overall, despite some methodological limitations of the included studies, the results have shown almost univocally that urban greenspaces harbour potentially beneficial effects on physical and mental health and well-being.

T1  - Knowledge Integration in the Politics and Policy of Rapid Transitions to Net Zero Carbon: A Typology and Mapping Method for Climate Actors in the UK
AN  - 2524987546
AB  - The types of political and policy knowledge required to guide rapid transition to low-carbon economies remain largely disconnected in the fields of political science, psychology, and sociology. The composition and key features of the main actors involved, and their relationships have also not been systematically described. This paper attempts to address these knowledge gaps by proposing a new, integrative typology of actors involved in climate change mitigation policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and a method for mapping these actors and selecting their typological descriptors onto a 2D space. The mapping method enables stakeholders to visualise and evaluate the strength of support for the UK government’s net-zero-by-2050 “green growth” strategy and the tensions, challenges, and strategic opportunities potentially facing more radical alternatives. The methodology could be replicated for climate actors in other countries and, in principle, for any geographical scale or level of governance.

T1  - Road Emissions in London: Insights from Geographically Detailed Classification and Regression Modelling
AN  - 2524466762
AB  - Greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions originating from road transport continues to rise in the UK, indicating a significant contribution to climate change and negative impacts on human health and ecosystems. However, emissions are usually estimated at aggregated levels, and on many occasions roads of minor importance are not taken into account, normally due to lack of traffic counts. This paper presents a methodology enabling estimation of air pollutants and CO2 for each street segment in the Greater London area. This is achieved by applying a hybrid probabilistic classification–regression approach on a set of variables believed to affect traffic volumes and utilizing emission factors. The output reveals pollution hot spots and the effects of open spaces in a spatially rich dataset. Considering the disaggregated approach, the methodology can be used to facilitate policy making for both local and national aggregated levels.

T1  - A Detailed Record of Deglacial and Early Post-Glacial Fluvial Evolution: The River Ure in North Yorkshire, UK
AN  - 2521486350
AB  - The lower reaches of the River Ure, on the flanks of the Pennine Hills in northern England, contain sedimentary and erosional landforms that are a record of fluvial activity during deglaciation and valley-glacier retreat at the end of the last (Devensian) glacial period, and in the subsequent post-glacial Holocene. Terraces and channels, most of which are now relict features well above the altitude of the present river, attest to the impacts of massive meltwater discharge and deposition of sand and gravel outwash, and dynamic river regimes with rapid incision. Through field survey, we have created a detailed geomorphological map of these landforms and glacial and fluvioglacial surface deposits, as well as the terraces and palaeochannels that were abandoned by the river due to avulsion and incision-driven course changes. We have recorded the nature of the outwash gravels, now effectively terrace features, from exposed sections in working quarries, one of which we discuss here. The palaeochannels have accumulated sediment fills and we have examined several which lie within the range of 100 and 16 m above present sea level. The results of lithostratigraphic, palynological, and radiocarbon analyses at two main and three subsidiary sites indicate that palaeochannel ages range from almost 14,000 to approximately 4000 calibrated years ago in a clear altitudinal sequence. The oldest are probably caused by rapid incision due to deglaciation-driven isostatic uplift. The similarity in date of the three downstream sites suggests that a late Holocene combination of climatic deterioration and increased human activity in the catchment caused instability and entrenchment. Pollen data from the channel fills provide relative dating, and agree well with pollen records from other regional Lateglacial and Holocene sites. Non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) analysis at one of the sites allows reconstruction of the hydrological history of channel infill. This research shows that the application of an integrated suite of research techniques can yield a highly detailed understanding of fluvial evolution and landscape history.

T1  - Innovative Techniques in the Context of Actions for Flood Risk Management: A Review
AN  - 2521254148
AB  - The general purpose of this review paper is to provide an overview of various flood protection strategies because flooding is becoming more frequent and is affecting more areas, displacing people, and increasing fatalities around the world. The concern surrounding climate change resulting in sea level rise, increasingly frequent storm events, and the need for adaptive actions to better control urban storm water runoff motivates the completion of this paper. Understanding the impact of climate change aside from dangerous weather conditions essential for designing effective mitigation strategies, but first, there needs to be a clear and strong understanding of the effects of extreme events. This review represents engineered storm water practices that are adaptive, in combination with the non-structural measures such as urban planning, will help reduce flood impact.

T1  - Modelling transport emission of an out of town centre to achieve emission reduction targets
AN  - 2515863549
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 6th International Symposium on Environment-Friendly Energies and Applications (EFEA)Conference Start Date:  2021,  March  24 Conference End Date:  2021,  March  26 Conference Location: Sofia, BulgariaTransportation negatively affects the environment due to a high carbon footprint associated with travel. In this paper, we estimate the commuter travel emissions of an out-of-town centre and evaluate the modelled emission against the targets set out by the UK government for 2030 (Climate Change Act), and 2050 (Committee on Climate Change, Kyoto protocol). For the study, primary data is provided by a leading retail centre in the UK in the form of home postcode, and mode selected by its staff for the commute. Each trip’s details are extracted using a macro code linking the journey details with google map. An emission model is constructed through the Department for Transport’s, Transport Appraisal Guidelines. Modelling for: a) Present mode share, b) Car only, and c) Bus only, with horizon modelling from 2010-2030. There are 3,444 staff working in the centre, 1743 (51%) use a car and 1701 (49%) bus for the everyday commute. Presently the average emission per person is 3 kg CO2e, modelled to decrease to 2.3 kg CO2e per journey by 2050. It is concluded from the study that a) average emissions for the same trip are expected to decrease, b) the emissions for bus journey are much lower than that of car, c) the targets set out for 2030, and 2050 will not be met if the present travel patterns continue. The modelling has considered advancements in technology, cleaner fuels, and electric vehicles' uptake. The deviation from 2030 and 2050 target is modelled as 29% and 56% respectively. The setout emissions targets are achievable only if a significant change in travel behaviour occurs supplemented by the uptake of sustainable transport modes such as cycling. This study endorses the adverse effects of travel on the environment and makes a case for stronger actions to reduce the travel carbon footprint

T1  - Isoprene and monoterpene emissions from alder, aspen and spruce short-rotation forest plantations in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2514930264
AB  - An expansion of bioenergy has been proposed to help reduce fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emissions, and short-rotation forestry (SRF) can contribute to this expansion. However, SRF plantations could also be sources of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, which can impact atmospheric air quality. In this study, emissions of isoprene and 11 monoterpenes from the branches and forest floor of hybrid aspen, Italian alder and Sitka spruce stands in an SRF field trial in central Scotland were measured during two years (2018–2019) and used to derive emission potentials for different seasons. Sitka spruce was included as a comparison as it is the most extensive plantation species in the UK. Winter and spring emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes were small compared to those in summer. Sitka spruce had a standardised mean emission rate of 15 µgCg-1h-1 for isoprene in the dry and warm summer of 2018 – more than double the emissions in 2019. However, standardised mean isoprene emissions from hybrid aspen were similar across both years, approximately 23 µgCg-1h-1, and standardised mean isoprene emissions from Italian alder were very low. Mean standardised total monoterpene emissions for these species followed a similar pattern of higher standardised emissions in the warmer year: Sitka spruce emitting 4.5 and 2.3 µgCg-1h-1 for 2018 and 2019, aspen emitting 0.3 and 0.09 µgCg-1h-1, and Italian alder emitting 1.5 and 0.2 µgCg-1h-1, respectively. In contrast to these foliage emissions, the forest floor was only a small source of monoterpenes, typically 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower than foliage emissions on a unit of ground area basis. Estimates of total annual emissions from each plantation type per hectare were derived using the MEGAN 2.1 model. The modelled total BVOC (isoprene and monoterpenes) emissions of SRF hybrid aspen plantations were approximately half those of Sitka spruce for plantations of the same age. Italian alder SRF emissions were 20 times smaller than from Sitka spruce. The expansion of bioenergy plantations to 0.7 Mha has been suggested for the UK to help achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The model estimates show that, with such an expansion, total UK BVOC emissions would increase between <1 % and 35 %, depending on the tree species planted. Whereas increases might be small on a national scale, regional increases might have a larger impact on local air quality.

T1  - Seasonal calving in European Prehistoric cattle and its impacts on milk availability and cheese-making
AN  - 2512384594
AB  - Present-day domestic cattle are reproductively active throughout the year, which is a major asset for dairy production. Large wild ungulates, in contrast, are seasonal breeders, as were the last historic representatives of the aurochs, the wild ancestors of cattle. Aseasonal reproduction in cattle is a consequence of domestication and herding, but exactly when this capacity developed in domestic cattle is still unknown and the extent to which early farming communities controlled the seasonality of reproduction is debated. Seasonal or aseasonal calving would have shaped the socio-economic practices of ancient farming societies differently, structuring the agropastoral calendar and determining milk availability where dairying is attested. In this study, we reconstruct the calving pattern through the analysis of stable oxygen isotope ratios of cattle tooth enamel from 18 sites across Europe, dating from the 6th mill. cal BC (Early Neolithic) in the Balkans to the 4th mill. cal BC (Middle Neolithic) in Western Europe. Seasonal calving prevailed in Europe between the 6th and 4th millennia cal BC. These results suggest that cattle agropastoral systems in Neolithic Europe were strongly constrained by environmental factors, in particular forage resources. The ensuing fluctuations in milk availability would account for cheese-making, transforming a seasonal milk supply into a storable product.

T1  - Rethinking Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability in Light of Economic Performance
AN  - 2497653637
AB  - Concepts of ethical behavior and corporate social responsibility have emerged in recent years due to organizations’ increasing ethical problems. Business ethics, social responsibility, and corporate governance are significant drivers for organizational performance, growth, and sustainable development (SD). In this paper, we propose an original tool, at a macroeconomic level, for the integration of concepts such as business ethics (BE), corporate social responsibility (CSR), and corporate governance (CG). The paper also seeks to establish the relationships among corporate responsibility dimensions (CR), sustainability, and economic performance. This research used the Sustainable Development Report 2020, Candriam’s ESG Country Report, World Bank Doing Business 2020 Report, World Bank national accounts data, and Eurostat as data sources. As part of the research, we selected the European Union states (27) plus the United Kingdom. The main results reveal the positive direct and indirect influences of corporate responsibility on economic performance, ultimately leading to sustainable development.

T1  - Learning to Design with Stakeholders: Participatory, Collaborative, and Transdisciplinary Design in Postgraduate Landscape Architecture Education in Europe
AN  - 2497615322
AB  - Over the last few decades, interaction and collaboration with stakeholders and communities in the design and development of our environment have become integral parts of landscape architecture practice. This article explores the position of this kind of designing in postgraduate landscape architecture education in Europe. An analysis of the international master’s curricula in landscape architecture of 29 universities across Europe shows there is some attention paid to participatory, collaborative, and transdisciplinary design in several, but not all programs. However, participatory, collaborative, and transdisciplinary design is an important topic in the current discourse amongst landscape architecture scholars. This may indicate an increase in attention to the topic in European landscape architecture education curricula in the (near) future.

T1  - The Role of Anaerobic Digestion in Reducing Dairy Farm Greenhouse Gas Emissions
AN  - 2497469028
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dairy farms are significant contributors to global warming. However, much of the published work on GHG reduction is focused on either methane (CH4) or nitrous oxide (N2O), with few, if any, considering the interactions that changes to farming systems can have on both gases. This paper takes the raw data from a year of activity on a 300-cow commercial dairy farm in Northern Ireland to more accurately quantify GHG sources by use of a simple predictive model based on IPCC methodology. Differing herd management policies are examined together with the impact of integrating anaerobic digestion (AD) into each farming system. Whilst significant success can be predicted in capturing CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) as biogas and preventing N2O emissions, gains made can be lost in a subsequent process, negating some or all of the advantage. The process of extracting value from the captured resource is discussed in light of current farm parameters together with indications of other potential revenue streams. However, this study has concluded that despite the significant potential for GHG reduction, there is little incentive for widespread adoption of manure-based farm-scale AD in the UK at this time.

T1  - The Common Approaches of Nitrogen Removal in Bioretention System
AN  - 2497214474
AB  - Bioretention is considered one of the best management practices (BMPS) for managing stormwater quality and quantity. The bioretention system has proven good performance in removing total suspended solids, oil, and heavy metals. The nitrogen (N) removal efficiency of the bioretention system is insufficient, however, due to the complex forms of nitrogen. Therefore, this paper aims to review recent enhancement approaches to nitrogen (N) removal and to discuss the factors influencing bioretention efficiency. To improve bioretention efficiency, several factors should be considered when designing bioretention systems, including nitrogen concentration, climate factors, and hydrological factors. Further, soil and plant selection should be appropriate for environmental conditions. Three design improvement approaches have been reviewed. The first is the inclusion of a saturated zone (SZ), which has been used widely. The SZ is shown to have the best performance in nitrogen removal. The second approach (which is less popular) is the usage of additives in the form of a mixture with soil media or as a separated layer. This concept is intended to be applied in tropical regions with wet soil conditions and a short dry period. The third approach combines the previous two approaches (enhanced filter media and applying a SZ). This approach is more efficient and has recently attracted more attention. This study suggests that further studies on the third approach should be carried out. Applying amendment material through filter media and integrating it with SZ provides appropriate conditions to complete the nitrogen cycle. This approach is considered a promising method to enhance nitrogen removal. In general, the bioretention system offers a promising tool for improving stormwater quality.

T1  - Generic Feasibility Assessment: Helping to Choose the Nuclear Piece of the Net Zero Jigsaw
AN  - 2494066566
AB  - The United Kingdom has declared a climate change policy of 100% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Efforts thus far have been limited solely to electricity generation methods. While progress has been admirable, effort now must be directed at the nation’s non-electrical energy use. Nuclear energy is an essential part of any energy future, since it is low-carbon, firm and supplies synchronous electricity; however the nation’s nuclear strategy to date has been erratic, costly and lacking in strategic oversight. A multitude of reactor designs are on offer for potential uptake, and decision-makers must have clarity of vision on what these systems must deliver before forming a strategy. Choosing between these systems, given the uncharted energy future faced by the UK is a daunting prospect. Generic feasibility assessment offers a tool for decision-makers to assist them in selecting the most suitable nuclear system for chosen future conditions. Generic feasibility assessment offers an alternative to traditional multi-attribute decision analyses, which can be confusing to even committed stakeholders when large numbers of attributes are weighted and compiled. Generic feasibility assessment forms part of a toolkit which will be of utility in achieving net zero by 2050, given the short time that remains.

T1  - The Potential for Regenerated Protein Fibres within a Circular Economy: Lessons from the Past Can Inform Sustainable Innovation in the Textiles Industry
AN  - 2493310008
AB  - Humanity is currently facing a crisis of excess, with a growing population and the trend towards disposable goods, and the world’s resources are under tremendous pressure. This is especially evident in the textiles industry, with increasing consumer numbers and the trend of ‘fast fashion’ causing demand to be at an all-time high, with non-renewable feedstocks depleting and production of natural fibres also under strain. Considering the future of textile production, it can be beneficial to investigate our past for inspiration towards more sustainable approaches. Much of the research into regenerated protein fibres was performed out of necessity during wartime, and while this demonstrates the potential for food waste to be exploited as a resource, the manufacturing methods used at the time now present issues for a circular economy due to the high amounts of toxic waste produced. Using a range of historical and modern literature sources, including journal articles, patents and conference papers, this review presents the historical precedent and research performed into azlons, regenerated fibres produced from waste protein-rich materials. Historical evidence shows that the success of these azlon fibres was short-lived, partly due to negative associations with deprivation and hardship, alongside the emergence of alternative man-made fibres, which were devoid of these connotations with never-before-seen physical properties. The social and political climate leading to the creation, and ultimate demise, of azlons is explored along with the influence of evolving technologies and the marketing of these textile products to consumers. Although the creation of products from waste is not a new concept, the literature has identified that the synergy between the challenges faced in a time of resource scarcity and the current trend of problematic excess reveals an exciting opportunity to learn from our past to create a greener future. Lessons that could help with the current crisis within the textile industry are extracted and presented within the concept of a circular textiles economy. Our findings show that there is notable potential for one regenerated protein fibre, made from casein extracted from milk waste, to be manufactured within a localised, circular economy in conjunction with the principles of green chemistry and sustainable textiles technology.

T1  - Dynamic Complex Network Analysis of PM2.5 Concentrations in the UK, Using Hierarchical Directed Graphs (V1.0.0)
AN  - 2492211619
AB  - The risk of a broad range of respiratory and heart diseases can be increased by widespread exposure to fine atmospheric particles on account of their capability to have a deep penetration into the blood streams and lung. Globally, studies conducted epidemiologically in Europe and elsewhere provided the evidence base indicating the major role of PM2.5 leading to more than four million deaths annually. Conventional approaches to simulate atmospheric transportation of particles having high dimensionality from both transport and chemical reaction process make exhaustive causal inference difficult. Alternative model reduction methods were adopted, specifically a data-driven directed graph representation, to deduce causal directionality and spatial embeddedness. An undirected correlation and a directed Granger causality network were established through utilizing PM2.5 concentrations in 14 United Kingdom cities for one year. To demonstrate both reduced-order cases, the United Kingdom was split up into two southern and northern connected city communities, with notable spatial embedding in summer and spring. It continued to reach stability to disturbances through the network trophic coherence parameter and by which winter was construed as the most considerable vulnerability. Thanks to our novel graph reduced modeling, we could represent high-dimensional knowledge in a causal inference and stability framework.

T1  - A secondary analysis of the childhood obesity prevention Cochrane Review through a wider determinants of health lens: implications for research funders, researchers, policymakers and practitioners
AN  - 2490926606
AB  - Background 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are often regarded as the gold standard of evidence, and subsequently go on to inform policymaking. Cochrane Reviews synthesise this type of evidence to create recommendations for practice, policy, and future research. Here, we critically appraise the RCTs included in the childhood obesity prevention Cochrane Review to understand the focus of these interventions when examined through a wider determinants of health (WDoH) lens.
 Methods 
We conducted a secondary analysis of the interventions included in the Cochrane Review on “Interventions for Preventing Obesity in Children”, published since 1993. All 153 RCTs were independently coded by two authors against the WDoH model using an adaptive framework synthesis approach. We used aspects of the Action Mapping Tool from Public Health England to facilitate our coding and to visualise our findings against the 226 perceived causes of obesity.
 Results 
The proportion of interventions which targeted downstream (e.g. individual and family behaviours) as opposed to upstream (e.g. infrastructure, environmental, policy) determinants has not changed over time (from 1993 to 2015), with most intervention efforts (57.9%) aiming to change individual lifestyle factors via education-based approaches. Almost half of the interventions (45%) targeted two or more levels of the WDoH. Where interventions targeted some of the wider determinants, this was often achieved via upskilling teachers to deliver educational content to children. No notable difference in design or implementation was observed between interventions targeting children of varying ages (0–5 years, 6–12 years, 13–18 years).
 Conclusions 
This study highlights that interventions, evaluated via RCTs, have persisted to focus on downstream, individualistic determinants of obesity over the last 25 years, despite the step change in our understanding of its complex aetiology. We hope that the findings from our analysis will challenge research funders, researchers, policymakers and practitioners to reflect upon, and critique, the evidence-based paradigm in which we operate, and call for a shift in focus of new evidence which better accounts for the complexity of obesity.

T1  - Dying to Go Green: The Introduction of Resomation in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2486366339
AB  - In an age where concern for the environment is paramount, individuals are continuously looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint—does this now extend to in one’s own death? How can one reduce the environmental impact of their own death? This paper considers various methods of disposing the human body after death, with a particular focus on the environmental impact that the different disposal techniques have. The practices of ‘traditional’ burial, cremation, ‘natural’ burial, and ‘resomation’ will be discussed, with focus on the prospective introduction of the funerary innovation of the alkaline hydrolysis of human corpses, trademarked as ‘Resomation’, in the United Kingdom. The paper situates this process within the history of innovative corpse disposal in the UK in order to consider how this innovation may function within the UK funeral industry in the future, with reference made to possible religious perspectives on the process.

T1  - Road Emissions in London: Insights from Geographically Detailed Classification and Regression Modelling
AN  - 2486212887
AB  - Greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions originating from road transport continues to rise in the UK, indicating a significant contribution to climate change and negative impacts on human health and ecosystems. However, emissions are usually estimated at aggregated levels, and on many occasions roads of minor importance are not taken into account, normally due to lack of traffic counts. This paper presents a methodology enabling estimation of air pollutants and CO2 for each street segment in the Greater London area. This is achieved by applying a hybrid probabilistic classification–regression approach on a set of variables believed to affect traffic volumes and utilizing emission factors. The output reveals pollution hot spots and the effects of open spaces in a spatially rich dataset. Considering the disaggregated approach, the methodology can be used to facilitate policy making for both local and national aggregated levels.

T1  - Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation Challenges in Szekszárd Wine Region, Hungary
AN  - 2484219172
AB  - Wine producers face several challenges regarding climate change, which will affect this industry both in the present and the future. Vulnerability assessments are at the forefront of current climate research, therefore, the present paper has two main aims. First, to assess two components of climate vulnerability regarding the Szekszárd wine region, Hungary; second, to collect and analyze adaptation farming techniques in terms of environmental sustainability aspects. Exposure analyses revealed that the study area will face several challenges regarding intensive drought periods in the future. Sensitivity indicators show the climate-related characteristics of the most popular grapevines and their relatively high level of susceptibility regarding changing climatic patterns. Since both external and intrinsic factors of vulnerability show deteriorating trends, the development of adaptation actions is needed. Adaptation interventions often provide unsustainable solutions or entail maladaptation issues, therefore, an environmental-focused sustainability assessment of collected interventions was performed to avoid long-term negative path dependencies. The applied evaluation methodology pointed out that nature-based adaptation actions are preferred in comparison to using additional machines or resource-intensive solutions. This study can fill the scientific gap by analyzing this wine region for the first time, via performing an ex-ante lock-in analysis of available and widely used adaptation interventions in the viticulture sector.

T1  - Urban Planning and European Innovation Policy: Achieving Sustainability, Social Inclusion, and Economic Growth?
AN  - 2480984867
AB  - Innovation has become a guiding principle for European Union policy. Funding schemes, research, and planning across all Member States are expected to be innovative. This article provides a critical analysis of the drivers and effects of this evolution. While positive results have been achieved due to innovation policies, this article proposes that taking a wider critical perspective reveals important caveats. The article zooms in on the EU’s innovation policies by analysing policy documents, projects funded, and on-the-ground impact on three citizen initiatives. The analysis asks whether and how the EU’s self-set goals of sustainability, social inclusion, and economic growth are approached and met in them. The findings suggest a problematic funnelling process. First, an emphasis on innovation is created with the objective of systematically unblocking resistance to the development and implementation of novelties in the name of competitiveness, job creation, and economic growth. Second, the idea of innovation is very loosely defined, while, when translated into urban planning, it is interpreted narrowly in terms of efficiency and behavioural change, digitalization, and smart technologies. As a result, (narrowly defined) innovation-led economic growth begins to supersede alternative values and visions for the future of European cities and regions. This can represent a problem for EU Member States as it creates a very limited, risk-based, and divisive direction of development. To contribute to the (re-)establishment of alternatives, this article finally offers policy recommendations primarily concerned with the reinstatement of the public interest beyond innovation-centred planning perspectives.

T1  - Characterizing a legal–intellectual culture: Bacon, Coke, and seventeenth-century England
AN  - 2480027612
AB  - A characterization of the ideas of Francis Bacon and Edward Coke, two preeminent English lawyer-scholars, provides insights into the nature of the legal–intellectual culture of early seventeenth-century England. This emerging culture remains underexplored, even though it immediately preceded and provided essential input into the ‘culture of growth,' the eighteenth-century cultural paradigm viewed as a catalyst for England's historically unprecedented technological advance and economic growth. To develop insights, we employ a methodology not previously used in this context, applying structural topic modeling to a large corpus comprising the works of both Bacon and Coke. Estimated topics span legal, political, scientific, and methodological themes. Legal topics evidence an advanced structure of common-law thought, straddling ostensibly disparate areas of the law. Interconnections between topics reveal a distinctive approach to the pursuit of knowledge, embodying Bacon's epistemology and Coke's legal methodology. A key similarity between Bacon and Coke overshadows their differences: both sought to build reliable knowledge based on generalizing from particulars. The resulting methodological paradigm can be understood as reflecting a legacy of common-law thought and constituting a key contribution to the era's emerging legal–intellectual culture. More generally, our analysis illustrates how machine learning applied to primary texts can aid in exploration of culture.

T1  - An Innovative Approach to Designing Digital Health Solutions Addressing the Unmet Needs of Obese Patients in Europe
AN  - 2478350012
AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975. In Europe, more than half of the population is overweight and obese. Around 2.8 million people die each year worldwide as a result of conditions linked to being overweight or obese. This study aimed to analyze the policies, approaches, and solutions that address the social and health unmet needs of obese patients, at different levels, in order to simulate the definition of an integrated approach, and to provide and share examples of innovative solutions supporting health promotion, disease prevention, and integration of services to improve the collaboration between the different health and care stakeholders involved across the country and in the lives of obese patients. A collaborative approach involving various levels of government and regional experts from different European countries was applied to identify, explore, and evaluate different aspects of the topic, from the innovation perspective and focusing on a European and a regional vision. Currently, people prefer more foods rich in fats, sugars, and salt/sodium than fruits, vegetables, and fiber. This behavior leads to a significant negative impact on their health-related quality of life. Changes in healthcare systems, healthy policy, and approaches to patient care and better implementation of the different prevention strategies between all the stakeholders are needed, taking advantage of the digital transformation of health and care. Such changes can support obese patients in their fight against an unhealthy lifestyle and at the same time reduce healthcare costs.

T1  - Knowledge Integration in the Politics and Policy of Rapid Transitions to Net Zero Carbon: A Typology and Mapping Method for Climate Actors in the UK
AN  - 2478311389
AB  - The types of political and policy knowledge required to guide rapid transition to low-carbon economies remain largely disconnected in the fields of political science, psychology, and sociology. The composition and key features of the main actors involved, and their relationships have also not been systematically described. This paper attempts to address these knowledge gaps by proposing a new, integrative typology of actors involved in climate change mitigation policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and a method for mapping these actors and selecting their typological descriptors onto a 2D space. The mapping method enables stakeholders to visualise and evaluate the strength of support for the UK government’s net-zero-by-2050 “green growth” strategy and the tensions, challenges, and strategic opportunities potentially facing more radical alternatives. The methodology could be replicated for climate actors in other countries and, in principle, for any geographical scale or level of governance.

T1  - Structure-from-Motion-Derived Digital Surface Models from Historical Aerial Photographs: A New 3D Application for Coastal Dune Monitoring
AN  - 2474766455
AB  - Recent advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques have proliferated the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the monitoring of coastal landform changes, particularly when applied in the reconstruction of 3D surface models from historical aerial photographs. Here, we explore a number of depth map filtering and point cloud cleaning methods using the commercial software Agisoft Metashape Pro to determine the optimal methodology to build reliable digital surface models (DSMs). Twelve different aerial photography-derived DSMs are validated and compared against light detection and ranging (LiDAR)- and UAV-derived DSMs of a vegetated coastal dune system that has undergone several decades of coastline retreat. The different studied methods showed an average vertical error (root mean square error, RMSE) of approximately 1 m, with the best method resulting in an error value of 0.93 m. In our case, the best method resulted from the removal of confidence values in the range of 0–3 from the dense point cloud (DPC), with no filter applied to the depth maps. Differences among the methods examined were associated with the reconstruction of the dune slipface. The application of the modern SfM methodology to the analysis of historical aerial (vertical) photography is a novel (and reliable) new approach that can be used to better quantify coastal dune volume changes. DSMs derived from suitable historical aerial photographs, therefore, represent dependable sources of 3D data that can be used to better analyse long-term geomorphic changes in coastal dune areas that have undergone retreat.

T1  - How the meanings of ‘home’ influence energy-consuming practices in domestic buildings
AN  - 2473318764
AB  - The UK introduced carbon budgets in 2008, with an aim to reduce greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050 compared with the 1990 levels. It has been argued that the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting the global average temperature rise to ‘well below 2° C’ requires deeper and more rapid emission reductions than the current UK targets. Household energy consumption accounts for almost a third of total UK CO2 emissions in recent years. This paper explores drivers of high energy consumption in domestic buildings from a sociological practice perspective and through a lens of dominant meanings of ‘home’. Whilst the practice approach and meanings of home have been explored separately in the literature to understand household energy consumption, this paper adds new findings on the interaction between the meanings of home and the elements of practices. Results show the dominant meaning of home differs between householders; this in turn affects the materials and procedures of energy-consuming practices. For instance, if ‘home’ means ‘hospitality’, this changes the standard of comfort and convenience people perceive at home. Understanding how practices and meanings of the home intersect, provides new, much needed insights that could support policy change commensurate with more rapidly reducing CO2 emissions from domestic energy consumption.

T1  - 'I WOULD RATHER GO ON BEING UNDERDEVELOPED.' REREADING AND RECONTEXTUALISING EDMUNDO DESNOES'S 1965 NOVEL MEMORIAS DEL SUBDESARROLLO
AN  - 2583133690
AB  - This article follows two lines of inquiry. First, it provides a rereading of the novel Memorias del subdesarrollo (Desnoes 1965), suggesting that the protagonist, Sergio, is affected by the threat of nuclear war throughout the novel and that this fear dominates the text from the outset, and not just the novel's ending during the Missile Crisis of October 1962. It argues that Sergio's state of anxiety and inertia derive as much from this fear as from his intellectual detachment and problematic relationship with the Cuban Revolution, where critical attention has tended to focus. This rereading gives texture to Sergio's inaction and nihilism, revealing a coherent response of an individual to the threat of catastrophe. Secondly, this article sets this rereading against a new context of catastrophe: that of climate change, ecosystem collapse and species extinction. In this context an overlooked revolutionary fervour is detected in Sergio that provides a reading of hope in the narrative that, when read analogously against the present, may reflect a sense of hope against calamity.

T1  - Achieving biodiversity net gain in a neoliberal economy: The case of England
AN  - 2564701923
AB  - The United Kingdom Government intends to require land development in England to contribute to improving biodiversity values. The basis for this, the offsetting of impacts on biodiversity, stems from and reinforces a neoliberal economic approach, fits with the privatising of conservation, and at a landscape level may improve biodiversity values. However, challenging decision-makers is the current lack of robust evidence that offsetting works, meaning allowing development despite uncertain future biodiversity benefits. Additionally, financial support for local government is declining, making it unclear whether and how effective independent auditing of biodiversity net gain will be.

T1  - Frankenstein and the Sciences of Self-Regulation
AN  - 2549060253
AB  - This essay argues that Romantic-era concepts of regulation help us to understand both how and why Mary Shelley's Frankenstein provided a critical commentary on the sciences and political theories of its time and why the novel has continued to serve as a cultural touchpoint for understanding the implications of new technologies (for example, genetic engineering). Concepts of regulation appear at key points in Frankenstein, including in Robert Walton's hopes that his trip to the North Pole will result in a scientific discovery about magnetism that can "regulate a thousand celestial observations" and in his and Victor Frankenstein's reflections on the relationship between their education and their identities. Concepts of regulation were also central for many eighteenth-century and Romantic-era natural scientists, philosophers, political economists, and political theorists (including Antoine Lavoisier, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, and William Godwin), and they were paramount to the development of "liberal" economic theory, which aimed to use the science of political economy to limit the power of the state. Robert Mitchell argues that Frankenstein takes up these concepts of regulation in order to critique this linkage of liberalism and the sciences, with the end of encouraging its readers to reimagine the components of liberalism in more equitable forms.

T1  - The "Quintessential Locus of Brokerage": Letters of Recommendation, Networks, and Mobility in the Life of Thomas Vanandets'i, an Armenian Printer in Amsterdam, 1677-1707·
AN  - 2542473945
AB  - This paper examines the role of early modern letters of recommendation as facilitators of trust and mobility across geographic and social networks in the early modern period, a topic neglected by world historians despite their focus on mobility and border crossing. The paper seeks to fill this gap in the scholarship by focusing on the "global microhistory" of Thomas Vanandets'i, an Armenian archbishop and printer who set up an Armenian printing press in Amsterdam in 1695 following his travels there from the South Caucasus. By examining the archbishop's multilingual letters of recommendation that paved his journey, the paper sheds light not only on how Armenians traveled across the many worlds of their early modern diaspora but also more generally on the question of how the ubiquitous yet understudied genre of the letter of recommendation served as the "quintessential locus of brokerage" for travelers and merchants across the early modern world.

T1  - UK's net-zero carbon emissions target: Investigating the potential role of economic growth, financial development, and R&D expenditures based on historical data (1870–2017)
AN  - 2511379579
AB  - The 4th industrial revolution and global decarbonisation are frequently referred to as two interrelated megatrends. Particularly, where the 4th industrial revolution is expected to fundamentally change the economy, society, and financial systems, it may also create opportunities for a zero-carbon future. Therefore, in the context of UK's legally binding commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050, we analyse the role of economic growth, R&D expenditures, financial development, and energy consumption in causing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Employing the bootstrapping bounds testing approach to examine short- and long-run relationships, our analysis is based on historical data from 1870 to 2017. The results suggest the existence of cointegration between CO2 emissions and its determinants. Financial development and energy consumption lead to environmental degradation, but R&D expenditures help to reduce CO2 emissions. The estimated environmental effects of economic growth support the EKC hypothesis. While a U-shaped relationship is found between financial development and CO2 emissions, the nexus between R&D expenditures and CO2 emissions is analogues to the EKC. In the context of the efforts to tackle climate change, our findings suggest policy prescriptions by using financial development and R&D expenditures as the key tools to meet the emissions target.

T1  - Development of a biogas distribution model for a wastewater treatment plant: a mixed integer linear programming approach
AN  - 2479499631
AB  - In this paper, we propose a realistic model for gas distribution of an advanced municipal wastewater treatment works and through minimisation of the total cost of gas distribution we perform retrospective optimisation (RO) using historical plant data. This site is the first in the UK with a mixed operational strategy for biomethane produced on site: to burn in combined heat and power (CHP) engines to create electricity, burn in steam boilers for onsite steam use or inject the biomethane into the National Grid. In addition, natural gas can be imported to make up shortfalls in biomethane if required. Implemented using a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach, to ensure a fast and robust solution, our results indicate the plant operated optimally within accepted tolerance 98% of the time. However, improving plant robustness (such as reducing unexpected breakdown incidents) could yield a significant increase in gas revenue of 7.8%.

T1  - Marking time in lockdown: heroization and ritualization in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic
AN  - 2471471816
AB  - Realism has predominated in discussions about the coronavirus pandemic where politicians, authorities, and commentators debate over the substance and consequence of scientific facts. But while biology played a crucial role in triggering the pandemic, the resulting crisis developed through a social process. In this paper, I argue that the coronavirus pandemic in Britain was successfully framed as a crisis, but that the ritualization of solidarity normally generated by this meaning was compromised. Through an analysis of media coverage and official statements from the government, I trace the discursive construction of the crisis through the deployment of battle metaphors. Building on this discourse analysis, I show how the symbolic alignment of the pandemic and the Second World War revived symbols and tropes that informed the cultural construction of pandemic heroes. To explain why the intensity of the crisis framing was not matched in ritual performance, I consider how the government’s ambiguous policies and erratic social performance produced a state of indefinite liminality, subverting solidarity processes in lockdown. The paper offers insight into the experience of anomie during the pandemic and contributes to the strong program in cultural sociology by incorporating the crisis approach in disaster studies into the social drama framework.

AN  - 2462283460
AB  - Populations undergoing rapid climate-driven range expansion experience distinct selection regimes dominated both by increased dispersal at the leading edges and steep environmental gradients. Characterisation of traits associated with such expansions provides insight into the selection pressures and evolutionary constraints that shape demographic and evolutionary responses. Here we investigate patterns in three components of wing morphology (size, shape, colour) often linked to dispersal ability and thermoregulation, along latitudinal gradients of range expansion in the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) in Britain (two regions of expansion in England and Scotland). We measured 774 males from 54 sites spanning 799 km with a 10-year mean average temperature gradient of 4 °C. A geometric morphometric method was used to investigate variation in size and shape of forewings and hindwings; colour, pattern, and contrast of the wings were examined using a measure of lightness (inverse degree of melanism). Overall, wing size increased with latitude by ∼2% per 100 km, consistent with Bergmann’s rule. Forewings became more rounded and hindwings more elongated with history of colonisation, possibly reflecting selection for increased dispersal ability. Contrary to thermal melanism expectations, wing colour was lighter where larvae developed at cooler temperatures and unrelated to long-term temperature. Changes in wing spot pattern were also detected. High heterogeneity in variance among sites for all of the traits studied may reflect evolutionary time-lags and genetic drift due to colonisation of new habitats. Our study suggests that temperature-sensitive plastic responses for size and colour interact with selection for dispersal traits (wing size and shape). Whilst the plastic and evolutionary responses may in some cases act antagonistically, the rapid expansion of P. aegeria implies an overall reinforcing effect between these two mechanisms.

T1  - Mitigating the Legacy Effects of Ditching in a New England Salt Marsh
AN  - 2638174428
AB  - The legacy effects of mosquito ditching have made salt marshes more vulnerable to flooding impacts from climate change, presenting management challenges in New England where the majority of salt marshes have been ditched and greater rates of sea level rise and storm events are being observed. One legacy effect of mosquito ditching appears to be subsidence of the marsh, with greater effects near the ditches and extending into the marsh plain. We found an average of 9 cm subsidence midway between ditches that averaged 14 m apart. Ditch Remediation is a new approach to filling ditches that uses existing hydrology and vegetation to mend ditches from the bottom up to restore marsh plain elevations. Smaller, auxiliary ditches are selected for treatment. Hay is mown, allowed to dry, and rolled into the treatment ditch where it is held using twine. Nine ditches in four areas were treated in fall 2014 and 2015. Depth of treated ditches decreased an average of 18 cm by fall 2017, and Spartina alterniflora colonized the ditch centers (plant cover and stem density increased). It is unknown whether the trajectory of filling and revegetation of the ditches will continue on their own or if the reduction in drainage depth will stimulate marsh plain building. Ditch remediation could remove excessive drainage effects of half the ditches, thereby approaching an optimal drainage density that may allow tidal marshes to rebuild elevation. This simple and inexpensive technique to reduce ditch impacts should be considered by partnerships that include mosquito control agencies.

T1  - Informing UK governance of resilience to climate risks: improving the local evidence-base
AN  - 2473381902
AB  - International assessments of evidence on climate change (e.g. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) or national climate change risk assessments (e.g. UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, CCRA) do not offer a sufficiently granular perspective on climate impacts to adequately inform governance of resilience to climate risks at the local level. Using an analysis of UK decision-makers managing and responding to heatwaves and flood risks, this paper argues how more robust local evidence is needed to inform decision-making regarding adaptation options for enhancing local resilience. We identify evidence gaps and issues relating to local climate change impacts, including sources and quality of evidence used, adequacy and accessibility of evidence available, ill-communicated evidence and conflicting or misused evidence. A lack of appreciation regarding how scientific evidence and personal judgement can mutually enhance the quality of decision-making underpins all of these gaps. Additionally, we find that the majority of evidence currently used is reductively based upon socio-economic and physical characteristics of climate risks. We argue that a step change is needed in local climate resilience that moves beyond current physical and socio-economic risk characterisation to a more inclusive co-constitution of social and politically defined climate risks at the local scale that are better aligned with the local impacts felt and needs of stakeholders.

T1  - The impacts of onshore-windfarms on a UK rural tourism landscape: objective evidence, local opposition, and national politics
AN  - 2419906701
AB  - Although the use of wind-turbines is widely accepted as generating clean and sustainable energy, when windfarms are sited in rural areas they are frequently opposed by locals because of their negative impacts, including on tourism. There is, however, little academic research on the role and significance of tourism in onshore-windfarm development disputes. The paper addresses this gap by way of a nuanced analysis of mixed-methods research undertaken on behalf of Northumberland County Council (NCC), UK, on the impacts of onshore-windfarms on tourism in Northumberland’s rural hinterland. We also trace the influence the research has had on NCC’s policy and land-use decision-making practices in the years since the research was completed in 2014, with particular focus on national policy changes enacted in 2016 that gave local communities more decision-making power on the siting of onshore-windfarms across the UK. From here we critique democratic decision-making on the development of onshore-windfarms more generally and consider political lessons learned from this case study that can have resonance anywhere wrestling with the same or similar issues.

T1  - No money for new drugs
AN  - 2471840976
AB  - By Benjamin Plackett When scientists, public-health bodies and governments around the world warn that antimicrobial resistance is the next great health crisis, they have good reason.

Since the 1960s, bacteria and other microorganisms have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial drugs, leading to more and more people dying.

[...]many large pharmaceutical firms have dropped out of the market in favour of pursuing profitable lines of drug development, such as cancer treatments (see 'Low approval ratings').

For a new drug to be included in the Australian government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which subsidizes the cost of medication, it has to be approved by a committee of health professionals and economists, who evaluate whether the drug offers value for money.

According to a policy review4 by the UK Office of Health Economics, the relatively short treatment cycle for a course of antibiotics reduces the volume that can be sold.

T1  - Shattering Silences: Dictions, Contradictions, and Ethnic Studies at the Crossroads
AN  - 2582443150
AB  - The decision by a secret ad hoc committee at Harvard University to deny tenure to Lorgia García-Peña and the subsequent refusal by university administrators to respond to protests and reconsider the decision are acts designed to discredit García-Peña and her scholarship. In reality, however, it is the university that has discredited itself. The ideal of meritocracy so central to the self-image and public legitimacy of institutions like Harvard has been exposed in this case as a self-serving lie. García-Peña is an original, generative, and award-winning scholar with an exemplary record of consistent peer validation from prestigious venues. In her work as a teacher and mentor, she created and directed the Latinx Secondary concentration, a graduate student certification program that trained some two dozen students across the disciplines at Harvard. Here, Lipsitz discusses the impact of the García-Peña scholarship.

T1  - Rise of British Petroaesthetics in King Coal’s Levee
AN  - 2557064502
AB  - Between the 1780s and the 1820s, Britain would transition from the solar-powered Holocene into the fossil-powered Anthropocene, seemingly motivated by new visions of the value of coal. King Coal’s Levee (1818) by John Scafe is one piece of literary culture that helped facilitate the transition to coal and Britain’s transformation into a fossil leviathan. Scafe’s poem, now mostly forgotten, was curiously popular between 1819 and 1820, going through four editions and the addition of extensive scientific notes by Oxford geologists William Buckland and William Daniel Conybeare. King Coal’s Levee helped create petroaesthetics whereby coal was not merely the fuel of the “English fire” but also the inexhaustible key to hegemony, sovereignty, and the future of the British nation.

T1  - Patterns of abundance across geographical ranges as a predictor for responses to climate change: Evidence from UK rocky shores
AN  - 2471520929
AB  - AimUnderstanding patterns in the abundance of species across thermal ranges can give useful insights into the potential impacts of climate change. The abundant‐centre hypothesis suggests that species will reach peak abundance at the centre of their thermal range where conditions are optimal, but evidence in support of this hypothesis is mixed and limited in geographical and taxonomic scope. We tested the applicability of the abundant‐centre hypothesis across a range of intertidal organisms using a large, citizen science‐generated data set.LocationUK.MethodsSpecies' abundance records were matched with their location within their thermal range. Patterns in abundance distribution for individual species, and across aggregated species abundances, were analysed using Kruskal–Wallis tests and quantile general additive models.ResultsIndividually, invertebrate species showed increasing abundances in the cooler half of the thermal range and decreasing abundances in the warmer half of the thermal range. The overall shape for aggregated invertebrate species abundances reflected a broad peak, with a cool‐skewed maximum abundance. Algal species showed little evidence for an abundant‐centre distribution individually, but overall the aggregated species abundances suggested a hump‐backed abundance distribution.Main ConclusionsOur study follows others in showing mixed support for the abundant‐centre hypothesis at an individual species level, but demonstrates an increased predictability in species responses when an aggregated overall response is considered.

T1  - Changes in positive associations among vertebrate predators at South Georgia during winter
AN  - 2440539978
AB  - We studied positive associations among seabirds and marine mammals at South Georgia on research cruises during the Austral winters of 1985, 1991 and 1993 and found statistically significant differences. We collected data on abundance and distribution, providing a critical reference for sub-Antarctic conservation in anticipation of future environmental changes. We found significant changes in the abundance of 29% of species surveyed and a consequent change in species diversity. We postulate that the resulting altered community composition may have previously unanticipated population effects on the component species, due to changes in positive interactions among species which use each other as cues to the presence of prey. We found a near threefold reduction in spatial overlap among vertebrate predators, associated with warming sea temperatures. As the strength and opportunity for positive associations decreases in the future, feeding success may be negatively impacted. In this way, environmental changes may disproportionately impact predator abundances and such changes are likely already underway, as Southern Ocean temperatures have increased substantially since our surveys. Of course the changes we describe are not solely due to changing sea temperature or any other single cause—many factors are important and we do not claim to have removed these from consideration. Rather, we report previously undocumented changes in positive associations among species, and argue these changes may continue into the future, given near-certain continued increases in climate-related changes.

T1  - The ability of seeds to float with water currents contributes to the invasion success of Impatiens balfourii and I. glandulifera
AN  - 2434613685
AB  - Two alien species in Europe, Impatiens glandulifera and I. balfourii, are closely related, have similar growth rates and reproductive capacities, and are very attractive to pollinators. Nevertheless, only I. glandulifera is a highly invasive alien species in Europe, while I. balfourii is non-invasive. We assumed that the varying levels of invasiveness are driven by differences in the floating ability of their seeds, which may determine the invasion success of riparian alien plants, such as the Impatiens species. By mimicking two types of aquatic conditions, we determined seed floating ability for each species from younger and older populations. We also analyzed four seed traits: seed viability, surface, shape and coat structure. Seeds of the non-invasive I. balfourii float less well than seeds of the invasive I. glandulifera. We also found that the seeds of I. balfourii from the younger population have a higher floating ability in comparison with that of the seeds from the older population. The results for I. glandulifera were the opposite, with decreased floating ability in the younger population. These differences were associated with seed surface, shape and coat structure. These results indicate that the floating ability of I. balfourii seeds may increase over time following its introduction into a given area, while in the case of I. glandulifera, this ability may gradually decrease. Therefore, the former species, currently regarded as a poor disperser, has the potential to become invasive in the future, whereas the latter does not seem to benefit from further investments in the floating ability of its seeds.

T1  - Machine learning for research on climate change adaptation policy integration: an exploratory UK case study
AN  - 2422472946
AB  - Understanding how climate change adaptation is integrated into existing policy sectors and organizations is critical to ensure timely and effective climate actions across multiple levels and scales. Studying climate change adaptation policy has become increasingly difficult, particularly given the increasing volume of potentially relevant data available, the validity of existing methods handling large volumes of data, and comprehensiveness of assessing processes of integration across all sectors and public sector organizations over time. This article explores the use of machine learning to assist researchers when conducting adaptation policy research using text as data. We briefly introduce machine learning for text analysis, present the steps of training and testing a neural network model to classify policy texts using data from the UK, and demonstrate its usefulness with quantitative and qualitative illustrations. We conclude the article by reflecting on the merits and pitfalls of using machine learning in our case study and in general for researching climate change adaptation policy.

T1  - Europe-wide precipitation projections at convection permitting scale with the Unified Model
AN  - 2424344078
AB  - For the first time, we analyze 2.2 km UK Met Office Unified Model convection-permitting model (CPM) projections for a pan-European domain. These new simulations represent a major increase in domain size, allowing us to examine the benefits of CPMs across a range of European climates. We find a change to the seasonality of extreme precipitation with warming. In particular, there is a relatively muted response for summer, which contrasts with much larger increases in autumn and winter. This flattens the hourly extreme precipitation seasonal cycle across Northern Europe which has a summer peak in the present climate. Over the Western Mediterranean, where autumn is the main extreme precipitation season, there is a regional increase in hourly extreme precipitation frequency, but local changes for lower precipitation thresholds are often insignificant. For mean precipitation, decreases are projected across Europe in summer, smaller decreases in autumn, and increases in winter; comparable changes are seen in the driving general circulation model (GCM) simulations. The winter mean increase is accompanied by a large decrease of winter mean snowfall. Comparing the driving GCM projections with the CPM ones, the CPMs show a robust enhanced intensification of precipitation extremes at the convection-permitting scale compared to coarser resolution climate model projections across various European regions for summer and autumn.

T1  - Waste to energy and circular economy: the case of anaerobic digestion
TT  - Waste to energy and circular economy
AN  - 2499020999
AB  - PurposeThis paper highlights how biological waste materials can be used for generating the much needed energy and obtaining nutrient-rich compost for agriculture through anaerobic digestion (AD). The paper further highlights the importance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in using AD for converting waste to energy (WTE), leading to many environmental benefits as well as clean energy generation. It would help to reduce pollution, water acidification and carbon emissions that eventually lead to climate change.Design/methodology/approachThe researchers undertook an in-depth study to highlight the role played by an SME in converting WTE and helping towards achieving circularity. An exploratory case-based approach was used to understand value leakage for an AD plant operating on WTE principles in the UK. The plant is still currently active, and it is located in the Midlands, England. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were undertaken with different stakeholders.FindingsThis paper reveals the importance of WTE and the significant role played by AD in converting food waste into useful matter. It reports further into the value leakage issue faced in the AD plants. It demonstrates the importance of technological innovation in SME to capture value leakages in a circular model. Most importantly, it demonstrates how SMEs gain competitive advantage and generate value proposition, while they aim for zero waste to landfill objective.Research limitations/implicationsThe research involves a case study based on an SME, operating on a circular business model. It will be worth investigating how other businesses could gain competitive advantage. For SMEs interested in AD for WTE, this paper introduces further technological innovation to the AD process to leverage further potential for reuse of waste liquid. Any SMEs entering WTE market ought to take into consideration such design implications.Practical implicationsThe paper reveals how the use of waste by SMEs would lead to many environmental benefits as well as clean energy generation. It would help to reduce pollution, water acidification and carbon emissions that eventually lead to climate change. It is useful for addressing the needs of waste food producers and is a cheap raw material for generating energy. The benefits to the public are that it reduces the need for landfill and increases recycling.Social implicationsThe WTE is an effective way of making use of last-stage waste.Originality/valueDespite SMEs being the powerhouse of the European economies, there is limited research investigating how circular economy (CE) could unlock their potential. Moreover, development of AD in the UK has lagged behind other EU countries. We highlight value leakages and argue how technological innovation should be used to close the value chain loop in the WTE production process. This paper, therefore, demonstrates the important role of an AD process, which involves decomposition of biodegradable materials. It shows that AD is an economically viable and environmentally friendly process of obtaining clean energy at low cost.

T1  - Effects of Storm Events on Phosphorus Concentrations in a Forested New England Stream
AN  - 2423654399
AB  - Phosphorus is considered the primary limiting nutrient in the freshwater aquatic ecosystems; thus, excessive concentrations of phosphorus (P) in streams and lakes can lead to eutrophication. Understanding the transport of P from minimally impacted watersheds provides a benchmark for quantifying human enhancement of P loss from the landscape. To better understand storm event transport of P from small watersheds of northern New England, we examined hourly variations in P in its multiple forms during three rain events at Livermore Cove Brook, New Hampshire, USA. The three storm events had different hydrological characteristics that resulted in different maximum total P concentrations. Streamwater P levels rose quickly at the onset of each event, remained high for a few hours during peak flow, and subsided as flow decreased. Dissolved organic P was the dominant species of P in the streamwater during baseflow and event flow. For each event, P concentrations were higher on the rising limbs of the hydrograph, resulting in clockwise hysteresis of the concentration-discharge relationships. Different behavior of the more inorganic, soluble reactive P hysteresis curve suggests a different source than the other P species. Both particulate and dissolved organic P were highest an hour before peak discharge and storm event water, suggesting quick mobilization of sources proximal to the stream. Soluble reactive P peaked an hour after discharge and storm event water, suggesting slower mobilization or more distal sources. Overall, these results show that storms create episodic peak concentrations of P that constitute a substantial flux of P to downstream lakes and wetlands. Consequently, efforts to manage P in New England lakes likely require greater attention to P transport during episodic storm events and their contribution to annual P loading.

T1  - Digital Cosmopolitanism: Notes from the Underground
AN  - 2746832541
AB  - This article interrogates new forms of digital cosmopolitanism(s) by introducing a critical postcolonial framework that allows an investigation of how digital connectivity operates in the everyday lives of migrants. We are talking today not of the disenfranchised but of the “connected migrant” (Diminescu 2008), a new citizen of the world, who is both rooted and routed, and whose global interactions are marked by the use of social networks. This allows physical distance to be bridged by digital proximity, creating new paradigms for the understanding of the affective turn online, which significantly changes the experience of migration and the idea of connectivity. Yet the ubiquity of digital connectivity does not mean an end to social inequalities; it can lead to new forms of isolation and radicalization for subaltern subjects. New forms of datafication, biometric assemblage, and algorithmic culture have intensified the ways in which bodies and identities can circulate across and beyond borders, heightening the speed of connectivity and circulation. Despite and because of these new technological innovations, many bodies remain stuck in space and kept on hold. The undesired effects of function creep, data leaks, and biometric sorting lead to discriminatory practices that put the notion of digital cosmopolitanism in jeopardy, reactivating old, long-standing forms of colonial practices and surveillance, but now in the form of data extraction and biometric categorizations. A postcolonial intervention into the notion of digital cosmopolitanisms is therefore needed in order to chart the reproductions of power asymmetries, by focusing, for example, not only on digital voices from below but also on the everydayness of cosmopolitanism and on the banal ways of engaging with digital connectivity and transnational belonging. This article is part of the Global Perspectives Communication and Media special issue on “Media, Migration, and Nationalism,” guest-edited by Koen Leurs and Tomohisa Hirata.

T1  - Cognitive Performance, Quality and Quantity of Movement Reflect Psychological Symptoms in Adolescents
AN  - 2572975316
AB  - The presentation of unhealthy psychological symptoms are rising sharply in adolescents. Detrimental lifestyle behaviours are proposed as both possible causes and consequences. This study set out to compare selected measures of quality and quantity of movement between adolescents with and without unhealthy psychological symptoms. Using a cross sectional design, 96 participants completed the study from a whole year group of 166, age (13.36 ± 0.48) male 50.6% from a secondary school in Oxfordshire, England as a part of a larger study (EPIC) between January and April 2018. Measures were taken of quality and quantity of movement: reaction/movement time, gait pattern & physical activity, alongside psychological symptoms. Differences in movement behaviour in relation to psychological symptom and emotional problem presentation were determined using ANOVA. In the event of a significant result for the main factor of each parameter, a Bonferroni -corrected post hoc test was conducted to show the difference between categories in each group. Results for both unhealthy psychological symptoms and emotional problems were grouped into four categories (‘Close to average’, ‘slightly raised’, ‘high’ and ‘very high’). Early adolescents with very high unhealthy psychological symptoms had 16.79% slower reaction times (p = 0.003, ηp2 = 0.170), 13.43% smaller walk ratio (p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.152), 7.13% faster cadence (p = 0.005, ηp2 = 0.149), 6.95% less step time (p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.153) and 1.4% less vigorous physical activity (p = 0.04, ηp2 = 0.102) than children with close to average psychological symptoms. Early adolescents with very high emotional problems had 12.25% slower reaction times (p = 0.05, ηp2 = 0.081), 10.61% smaller walk ratio (p = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.108), 6.03% faster cadence (p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.134), 6.07% shorter step time (p = 0.007, ηp2 = 0.141) and 1.78% less vigorous physical activity (p = 0.009, ηp2 = 0.136) than children with close to average emotional problems. Different movement quality and quantity of was present in adolescents with unhealthy psychological symptoms and emotional problems. We propose movement may be used to both monitor symptoms, and as a novel therapeutic behavioural approach. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.

T1  - USING INTERNATIONAL TRADE DATA TO INFORM THE PLANT HEALTH AND BIOSECURITY RESPONSE IN THE UK
AN  - 2428113978
AB  - The experimental statistics released by Defra in March 2020 'Plant Health - international trade and controlled consignments, 2014-2018' (Gov.UK, 2020) were developed to address some of the evidence gaps around plant health related trade and the value of plant health, and to provide users with information on the work of import inspectors.

[...]the coverage of EU trade does not capture trade below the Value Added Tax (VAT) threshold.

The notification data provide information on the situation as-is but with little contextual information or information on trade in relation to future threats, nor does the notification data include EU trade as plant passports are used within the EU and data are not held centrally on the number of passports issued.

Plant passports are an EU official document to move regulated plants and plant products within the EU; they assure compliance with all the plant health requirements for the relevant plant product and ensure there is trace-ability through the supply chain.

T1  - Optimal configuration and resolution for the first convection‐permitting ensemble of climate projections over the United Kingdom
AN  - 2411475277
AB  - Convection‐permitting models (CPMs) provide a better representation of sub‐daily precipitation statistics and convective processes on both climate and weather forecasting timescales. This study aims to establish what horizontal resolution and physical process settings are suitable for the first ensemble of convection‐permitting climate projections for the United Kingdom. For this purpose, 12‐year‐long simulations were run using three different convection‐permitting resolutions (grid spacing of 4 km, 2.2 km and 1.5 km) each with several configurations. The focus is on the ability to represent sub‐daily precipitation due to its potential for high impacts on society through flooding. The analysis shows that the use of a finer grid spacing within the convection‐permitting regime improves the representation of sub‐daily precipitation but the added value decreases as the grid becomes increasingly finer, while the computational costs substantially increase. Changes in the representation of physical processes can have as much impact as the grid spacing and can lead to similar differences in the diurnal cycle as between convection‐parametrized models and CPMs. Although the 4km model shows some key deficiencies that make it unreliable for climate projection, the 2.2km model performs as well as the 1.5km model for most of the metrics examined with considerable benefits in terms of computer cost. The optimal configuration and resolution identified here is being used for an ensemble of simulations run within the UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) project, which allows, for the first time, an estimate of uncertainty in future changes at convection‐permitting scale and providing more reliable climate change projections at local and hourly scales.

T1  - Healthcare providers’ adherence to breast cancer guidelines in Europe: a systematic literature review
AN  - 2402249997
AB  - PurposeClinical guidelines’ (CGs) adherence supports high-quality care. However, healthcare providers do not always comply with CGs recommendations. This systematic literature review aims to assess the extent of healthcare providers’ adherence to breast cancer CGs in Europe and to identify the factors that impact on healthcare providers’ adherence.MethodsWe searched for systematic reviews and quantitative or qualitative primary studies in MEDLINE and Embase up to May 2019. The eligibility assessment, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted by one author and cross-checked by a second author. We conducted a narrative synthesis attending to the modality of the healthcare process, methods to measure adherence, the scope of the CGs, and population characteristics.ResultsOut of 8137 references, we included 41 primary studies conducted in eight European countries. Most followed a retrospective cohort design (19/41; 46%) and were at low or moderate risk of bias. Adherence for overall breast cancer care process (from diagnosis to follow-up) ranged from 54 to 69%; for overall treatment process [including surgery, chemotherapy (CT), endocrine therapy (ET), and radiotherapy (RT)] the median adherence was 57.5% (interquartile range (IQR) 38.8–67.3%), while for systemic therapy (CT and ET) it was 76% (IQR 68–77%). The median adherence for the processes assessed individually was higher, ranging from 74% (IQR 10–80%), for the follow-up, to 90% (IQR 87–92.5%) for ET. Internal factors that potentially impact on healthcare providers’ adherence were their perceptions, preferences, lack of knowledge, or intentional decisions.ConclusionsA substantial proportion of breast cancer patients are not receiving CGs-recommended care. Healthcare providers’ adherence to breast cancer CGs in Europe has room for improvement in almost all care processes. CGs development and implementation processes should address the main factors that influence healthcare providers' adherence, especially patient-related ones.Registration:PROSPERO (CRD42018092884).

T1  - Stand growth and structure of mixed-species and monospecific stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Q. robur L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) analysed along a productivity gradient through Europe
AN  - 2298557154
AB  - Past failures of monocultures, caused by wind-throw or insect damages, and ongoing climate change currently strongly stimulate research into mixed-species stands. So far, the focus has mainly been on combinations of species with obvious complementary functional traits. However, for any generalization, a broad overview of the mixing reactions of functionally different tree species in different mixing proportions, patterns and under different site conditions is needed, including assemblages of species with rather similar demands on resources such as light. Here, we studied the growth of Scots pine and oak in mixed versus monospecific stands on 36 triplets located along a productivity gradient across Europe, reaching from Sweden to Spain and from France to Georgia. The set-up represents a wide variation in precipitation (456–1250 mm year−1), mean annual temperature (6.7–11.5 °C) and drought index by de Martonne (21–63 mm °C−1). Stand inventories and increment cores of trees stemming from 40- to 132-year-old, fully stocked stands on 0.04–0.94-ha-sized plots provided insight into how species mixing modifies stand growth and structure compared with neighbouring monospecific stands. On average, the standing stem volume was 436 and 360 m3 ha−1 in the monocultures of Scots pine and oak, respectively, and 418 m3 ha−1 in the mixed stands. The corresponding periodical annual volume increment amounted to 10.5 and 9.1 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the monocultures and 10.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the mixed stands. Scots pine showed a 10% larger quadratic mean diameter (p < 0.05), a 7% larger dominant diameter (p < 0.01) and a 9% higher growth of basal area and volume in mixed stands compared with neighbouring monocultures. For Scots pine, the productivity advantages of growing in mixture increased with site index (p < 0.01) and water supply (p < 0.01), while for oak they decreased with site index (p < 0.01). In total, the superior productivity of mixed stands compared to monocultures increased with water supply (p < 0.10). Based on 7843 measured crowns, we found that in mixture both species, but especially oak, had significantly wider crowns (p < 0.001) than in monocultures. On average, we found relatively small effects of species mixing on stand growth and structure. Scots pine benefiting on rich, and oak on poor sites, allows for a mixture that is productive and most likely climate resistant all along a wide ecological gradient. We discuss the potential of this mixture in view of climate change.

T1  - Examining the Potential of Art-Science Collaborations in the Anthropocene: A Case Study of Catching a Wave
AN  - 2404483507
AB  - There is a disconnect between ambition and achievement of the UN Agenda 2030 and associated Sustainable Development Goals that is especially apparent when it comes to ocean and coastal health. While scientific knowledge is critical to confront and resolve contradictions that reproduce unsustainable practices at the coast and to spark global societal change towards sustainability, it is not enough in itself to catalyse large scale behavioural change. People learn, understand and generate knowledge in different ways according to their experiences, perspectives, and culture, amongst others, which shape responses and willingness to alter behaviour. Historically, there has been a strong connection between art and science, both of which share a common goal to understand and describe the world around us as well as provide avenues for communication and enquiry. This connection provides a clear avenue for engaging multiple audiences at once, evoking emotion and intuition to trigger stronger motivations for change. There is an urgent need to rupture the engrained status-quo of disciplinary divisions across academia and society to generate transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental challenges. This paper describes the evolution of an art-science collaboration (Catching a Wave) designed to galvanise change in the Anthropocene era by creating discourse drivers for transformations that are more centred on society rather than the more traditional science-policy-practice nexus.

AN  - 2407768451
AB  - Farming in the UK relies on a secure water supply. Here, Dunn explores how can farmers make the best use of limited resources. Climate change will need to be a high priority in the planning system if emissions targets are to be met and resilience ensured. The UK government last year committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. At a local level, many councils have set even tougher targets. Bristol and Leeds City Councils both have targets for net-zero carbon by 2030, where any emissions would be balanced by absorbing equivalent amounts from the atmosphere. Nottingham City Council meanwhile has a carbon-neutral target for 2028, so that while some carbon could still be generated it would be offset elsewhere and overall net emissions would be zero; and Manchester City Council plans to be a zero-carbon city--emitting no carbon at all--by 2038.

T1  - Assessing climate impacts on English economic growth (1645–1740): an econometric approach
AN  - 2406914761
AB  - British pre-industrial economic growth has traditionally been analysed from the Malthusian point of view and other more optimistic approaches, but in many cases, ignoring environmental factors. This article explores the inclusion of the climate in this general debate, focusing on one of the colder periods of the last 500 years, known as the Maunder Minimum. The provisional results suggest that climate change and the resulting adaptations may have influenced the start of the English Agricultural Revolution, the Energy Transition and the European Divergence. However, from an econometric point of view these results are not fully conclusive, making it necessary to continue working with better primary sources and other alternative methodologies.

T1  - The Call to Play: New Work and Labor at Artsadmin
AN  - 2387236267
AB  - Copyright © American Society for Theatre Research 20202020American Society for Theatre ResearchFebruary 2010. The lights are off. As I adjust to the dark I can make out shapes of others scattered around the room. Disoriented and uncertain I wait for some sign or direction of what to do. The air is thick with anticipation, but as time drags it becomes clear that no instructions are coming. Then it begins all around me. Sat in the dark in a workshop in the courtroom studio of Toynbee Studios, I begin to feel anxious. I see the outline of another body in front of me and I panic. I should do something. I reach for anything that might keep things working, that might keep play going. Does anyone want to dance, I ask. I waltz. I sense someone dancing behind me.In what follows I think through my participation in a 2010 workshop led by Anne Bean, recounted in part above, to understand better the role of play in the conditions of production for theatre and performance under capital. Bean is an interdisciplinary artist, belonging to (or claimed by) multiple experimental art scenes, including visual, performance, and sound art, who has been a central figure of European live art since the 1970s. The workshop, which was conducted largely in the dark and focused on the aestheticization of cooperation through an emphasis on its participants doing play was held at Artsadmin's Toynbee Studios, the influential UK arts producing organization's home in East London. This article puts my account of Bean's workshop in conversation with Victorian economist Arnold Toynbee's demand for a new capitalist morality. Toynbee's appeal was, of course, not directed at me or the other workshop participants disoriented and uncertain in the dark. But, I argue, the situation of play that arose in Bean's workshop is a contemporary iteration of what Toynbee called a gospel of life, a term referring to a commitment to self and civic betterment at the core of a burgeoning capitalist morality. The connection between the shaping of Victorian labor practices and the staging of cooperation between participants in Bean's contemporary workshop is the basis for this essay's core assertion: that the value of play as a counterpoint to work within practices and discourses of theatre and performance needs considerable rethinking.

T1  - The State and International Law: A Reading from the Global South
AN  - 2444985843
AB  - International interventions of all kinds-humanitarian, military, developmental, and financial-are usually predicated on the idea that a state, which has emerged endogenously from "the people" "within," is being "assisted" from "outside"-to develop, to overcome civil war, to govern itself better. Such interventions are neither imagined nor constructed in law as actions that impose and stabilize a legal form, "the nation-state," from "outside," disciplining it from "within," to actualize and maintain that particular form. Indeed, the authority of international law as well as the operation of the international legal order relies on the twin myths that ground this reading: first, that states are independent juridical institutional formations that come into being once they are formed in "fact" and which are only later "recognized" as a matter of international law; and second, that sovereign states come before a law that they have consensually created.2 A classic textbook statement reflecting this mythic grounding might be, "In international law ... it is the states themselves that create the law and obey or disobey it."3 And yet this predicate is not only mythic but fictional: a fiction that conceals the world-making-via state-making-work of international law and institutions. This work is now intensifying in both scope and violence.In  this essay, we redescribe the relationship between international law and the state, reversing the imagined directionality of the flow that sequences nation-states coming first and international law second.5 At its most provocative, our argument is that, rather than international law being a creation of the state, making and remaking the state is a project of international law. We pay particular attention here to the institutionalized project of development in order to illuminate the ways in which international law creates and maintains nation-states, and then recirculates from a multiplicity of points "within" them.6 Understanding this process is particularly important when trying to make sense of the pasts and presents of the Global South, but is increasingly relevant to understanding reconfigurations of states in the north, too.

T1  - The Global Novel: Comparative Perspectives Introduction
AN  - 2429463534
AB  - "1 The conjunction of global with the novel generates considerable heartburn in some quarters about the form's complicity with the forces of globalization, its rampant marketability, its abdication of its social role, and the banal professionalization through creative writing programs of a form that was once symptomatic of high aesthetic pursuit.2 Even as one registers this disquiet, literary scholars can scarcely miss the explosion of comparative scholarship on the global novel, a sure sign that this form is wide open for critical and historical evaluation.

Recent scholarly work has embraced theories of comparative morphology (Franco Moretti); the mutual shaping of the novel and human rights discourse (Joseph Slaughter); cosmopolitical negotiation of social difference and otherness (David Palumbo-Liu); born-translated works that have an aspiration for cross-lingual circulation enfolded in their crafting (Rebecca Walkowitz); formal adaptation to modes of apperception characterizing our new media age and the temporal structure of the contemporary marked by global wars and cultures of humanitarian witnessing (Debjani Ganguly); anglophone territorialization and deterritorialization (Baidik Bhattacharya); strategic occidentalism and the neoliberal book market (Ignacio Sánchez Prado); the normative worlding of postcolonial and global south novels (Pheng Cheah); the novel's oceanic and terraqueous world-making (Margaret Cohen); and the novel's planetary scale in works of speculative fiction on climate change and species extinction (Ursula Heise), to name only a few.3 This astonishing conceptual range of the global, which factors in the philosophical weight of terms such as the world and the planetary, reveals that "the global is not a stable content or ideology or an institutional perspective continuous with empire and consonant with neoliberal globalization.

The global in such a reading signals the linguistic and cultural diversity of this fictional form across time and space, a mode of comparatism that this special issue enlists in the face of attempts to see the global novel as a standardized "bourgeois sociolect," and against a frequent disinclination to historicize its modern bourgeois origins athwart a wider canvas of literary, cultural, and philosophical influences.

7 This volume is at odds with two other meanings of the term global: one, its mimetic exactitude as a mode of cultural equivalence in a market of perfect exchangeability; and two, its historiographical coding as European diffusionism, that is, the march of the modern European novel form and its relentless capture of cultural difference across both time and space.

T1  - Projections of global and UK bioenergy potential from Miscanthus × giganteus —Feedstock yield, carbon cycling and electricity generation in the 21st century
AN  - 2390207009
AB  - In this article, we modify bioenergy model MiscanFor investigating global and UK potentials for Miscanthus × giganteus as a bioenergy resource for carbon capture in the 21st century under the RCP 2.6 climate scenario using SSP2 land use projections. UK bioenergy land projections begin in the 2040s, 60 year average is 0.47 Mega ha rising to 1.9 Mega ha (2090s). Our projections estimate UK energy generation of 0.09 EJ/year (60 year average) and 0.37 EJ/year (2090s), under stable miscanthus yields of 12 t ha−1 year−1. We estimate aggregated UK soil carbon (C) increases of 0.09 Mt C/year (60 year average) and 0.14 Mt C/year (2090s) with C capture plus sequestration rate of 2.8 Mt C/year (60 year average) and 10.49 Mt C/year (2090s). Global bioenergy land use begins in 2010, 90 year average is 0.13 Gha rising to 0.19 Gha by the 2090s, miscanthus projections give a 90 year average energy generation of 16 EJ/year, rising to 26.7 EJ/year by the 2090s. The largest national capabilities for yield, energy and C increase are projected to be Brazil and China. Ninety year average global miscanthus yield of 1 Gt/year will be 1.7 Gt/year by the 2090s. Global soil C sequestration increases less with time, from a century average of 73.6 Mt C/year to 42.9 Mt C/year by the 2090s with C capture plus sequestration rate of 0.54 Gt C/year (60 year average) and 0.81 Gt C/year (2090s). M. giganteus could provide just over 5% of the bioenergy requirement by the 2090s to satisfy the RCP 2.6 SSP2 climate scenario. The choice of global land use data introduces a potential source of error. In reality, multiple bioenergy sources will be used, best suited to local conditions, but results highlight global requirements for development in bioenergy crops, infrastructure and support.

T1  - Global‐scale species distributions predict temperature‐related changes in species composition of rocky shore communities in Britain
AN  - 2377254594
AB  - Changes in rocky shore community composition as responses to climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic warming can be shown by changes in average species thermal affinities. In this study, we derived thermal affinities for European Atlantic rocky intertidal species by matching their known distributions to patterns in average annual sea surface temperature. Average thermal affinities (the Community Temperature Index, CTI) tracked patterns in sea surface temperature from Portugal to Norway, but CTI for communities of macroalgae and plant species changed less than those composed of animal species. This reduced response was in line with the expectation that communities with a smaller range of thermal affinities among species would change less in composition along thermal gradients and over time. Local‐scale patterns in CTI over wave exposure gradients suggested that canopy macroalgae allow species with ranges centred in cooler than local temperatures (‘cold‐affinity’) to persist in otherwise too‐warm conditions. In annual surveys of rocky shores, communities of animal species in Shetland showed a shift in dominance towards warm‐affinity species (‘thermophilization’) with local warming from 1980 to 2018 but the community of plant and macroalgal species did not. From 2002 to 2018, communities in southwest Britain showed the reverse trend in CTI: declining average thermal affinities over a period of modest temperature decline. Despite the cooling, trends in species abundance were in line with the general mechanism of direction and magnitude of long‐term trends depending on the difference between species thermal affinities and local temperatures. Cold‐affinity species increased during cooling and warm‐affinity ones decreased. The consistency of responses across different communities and with general expectations based on species thermal characteristics suggests strong predictive accuracy of responses of community composition to anthropogenic warming.

T1  - Older people's experiences of everyday travel in the urban environment: a thematic synthesis of qualitative studies in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2371067383
AB  - Compared to younger age groups, older people spend more time in their locality and rely more heavily on its pedestrian and public transport infrastructure. Qualitative studies provide unique insight into people's experiences. We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis of United Kingdom-based studies of older people's experiences of travelling in the urban environment. We searched health, social science, age-related and transport-related databases from 1998 to 2017. Fourteen papers (from 12 studies) were included in a thematic synthesis, a three-staged process that moves iteratively between codes, descriptive themes and cross-cutting analytical themes. Emerging themes were discussed with policy advisers. Four overarching themes were identified. The first and second theme pointed to the importance of ‘getting out’ and of being independent travellers. The third and fourth themes highlighted how local environments and travel systems enabled (or prevented) older people from realising these valued dimensions of travel. The loss of local amenities and micro-environmental features, such as pavement quality, personal safety and aesthetic appearance, were recurrent concerns. Free modes of travel like walking and bus travel were highly valued, including the social engagement they facilitated. Our review suggests that, while its extrinsic value (reaching destinations) matters, the intrinsic value of travel matters too. The process of travel is experienced and enjoyed for its own sake, with older people describing its contribution to their wellbeing.

T1  - Learning from the 2018 heatwave in the context of climate change: are high-temperature extremes important for adaptation in Scotland?
AN  - 2548836309
AB  - To understand whether high temperatures and temperature extremes are important for climate change adaptation in Scotland, we place the 2018 heatwave in the context of past, present, and future climate, and provide a rapid but comprehensive impact analysis. The observed hottest day (d), 5 d, and 30 d period of 2018 and the 5 d period with the warmest nights had return periods of 5–15 years for 1950–2018. The warmest night and the maximum 30 d average nighttime temperature were more unusual with return periods of >30 years. Anthropogenic climate change since 1850 has made all these high-temperature extremes more likely. Higher risk ratios are found for experiments from the CMIP6-generation global climate model HadGEM3-GA6 compared to those from the very-large ensemble system weather@home. Between them, the best estimates of the risk ratios for daytime extremes range between 1.2–2.4, 1.2–2.3, and 1.4–4.0 for the 1, 5, and 30 d averages. For the corresponding nighttime extremes, the values are higher and the ranges wider (1.5- >50, 1.5–5.5, and 1.6- >50). The short-period nighttime extremes were more likely in 2018 than in 2017, suggesting a contribution from year-to-year climate variability to the risk enhancement of extreme temperatures due to anthropogenic effects. Climate projections suggest further substantial increases in the likelihood of 2018 temperatures between now and 2050, and that towards the end of the century every summer might be as hot as 2018. Major negative impacts occurred, especially on rural sectors, while transport and water infrastructure alleviated most impacts by implementing costly special measures. Overall, Scotland could cope with the impacts of the 2018 heatwave. However, given the likelihood increase of high-temperature extremes, uncertainty about consequences of even higher temperatures and/or repeated heatwaves, and substantial costs of preventing negative impacts, we conclude that despite its cool climate, high-temperature extremes are important to consider for climate change adaptation in Scotland.

T1  - The Manufacture and Characterisation of Rosid Angiosperm-Derived Biochars Applied to Water Treatment
AN  - 2394633487
AB  - Marabu (Dichrostachys cinerea) from Cuba and aspen (Populus tremula) from Britain are two rosid angiosperms that grow easily, as a weed and as a phytoremediator, respectively. As part of scientific efforts to valorise these species, their barks and woods were pyrolysed at 350, 450, 550 and 650 °C, and the resulting biochars were characterised to determine the potential of the products for particular applications. Percentage carbon composition of the biochars generally increased with pyrolysis temperature, giving biochars with highest carbon contents at 650 °C. Biochars produced from the core marabu and aspen wood sections had higher carbon contents (up to 85%) and BET surface areas (up to 381 m2 g−1) than those produced from the barks. The biochar porous structures were predominantly mesoporous, while micropores were developed in marabu biochars produced at 650 °C and aspen biochars produced above 550 °C. Chemical and thermal activation of marabu carbon greatly enhanced its adsorption capacity for metaldehyde, a molluscicide that has been detected frequently in UK natural waters above the recommended EU limit.

T1  - UKGrsHP: a UK high-resolution gauge–radar–satellite merged hourly precipitation analysis dataset
AN  - 2376094756
AB  - There is an urgent need for high-quality and high-spatial-resolution hourly precipitation products around the globe, including the UK. Although hourly precipitation products exist for the UK, these either contain large errors, or are insufficient in spatial resolution. An efficient way to solve this is to develop a merged precipitation product that combines the information and benefits from multiple data sources, improving both the spatial resolution and accuracy of hourly precipitation estimates over the UK. In this study, we develop a UK high-resolution gauge–radar–satellite merged hourly precipitation analysis: the UKGrsHP. It covers the UK from 12.5° W to  3.5° E, 49° N–60° N, with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° in latitude/longitude (equivalent to 1 km resolution in the mid-latitudes). An optimal interpolation (OI)–based multi-source merging scheme with compound strategy is developed and tested for producing the UKGrsHP. Three input data sources are used: gauge analysis data interpolated from 1903 quality-controlled hourly observations, the UK Nimrod radar precipitation analysis and the GSMaP global satellite precipitation analysis. Using independent tests against ~ 220 independent gauge observations on 1 year’s experimental UKGrsHP, covering the period from January to December 2014, we find that the final merged data performs better than three individual precipitation analyses used as inputs. A full version of the UKGrsHP starting in April 2004 is now under production, which will have wide applications in climate services and scientific research across multiple disciplines.

T1  - An investigation into UK government policy and legislation to renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction commitments
AN  - 2369255405
AB  - The UK has committed to various legally binding targets with regard to renewable energy technology and greenhouse gas reduction. As a result, government policy and legislation have been significant in investing in renewable energy technology, driving innovation since 1990. The aim of this work identifies the key drivers behind commitments and to assess the role of government, business and organisations in the uptake of renewable energy and the development of a decentralised energy network as a result of greenhouse gas emission reduction target. This article presents quantitative analysis of primary research from government and industry. The novel aspect of this investigation is that the conclusive outcomes arise as a result of a unique research method by combining primary and secondary sources with support of company data from Nestlé and Transport for London. The main findings demonstrated that government support is one of the key drivers for innovation into renewable technology; however, business and the public are necessary to bring renewables to market. Strategies have been identified to incorporate decentralised generation into industry for the commitment of renewables and to develop the required energy network of the future.Graphic abstract

AN  - 2352944739
AB  - Copyright © Cambridge University Press 20182018Cambridge University PressWhat is the history of science? How has it changed over the course of the twentieth century? And what does the future hold for the discipline? This ‘Retrospect’ provides an introduction to the historiography of science as it developed in the Anglophone world. It begins with the foundation of the Cambridge History of Science Committee in the 1940s and ends with the growth of cultural history in the 2000s. At the broadest level, it emphasizes the need to consider the close relationship between history and the history of science. All too often the historiography of science is treated separately from history at large. But as this essay shows, these seemingly distinct fields often developed in relation to one another. This essay also reveals the ways in which Cold War politics shaped the history of science as a discipline. It then concludes by considering the future, suggesting that the history of science and the history of political thought would benefit from greater engagement with one another.

T1  - THE 2019 BCPC CONGRESS - UNDERSTANDING THE DEMANDS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF A "GREEN BREXIT" - HOW DO WE DELIVER FOOD PRODUCTION ALONGSIDE ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT?
AN  - 2401217573
AB  - Whatever happens in the future regarding the UK's relationship with the EU, many changes in UK agriculture are expected as the government empathises on the environment rather than production, with farmers having to contend with fewer pesticides registered for use, increasing problems of insects, diseases and weeds resistant to pesticides and the impact of climate change.

Farmers will still have to produce high quality food at a low cost to the consumer as the EU policy is to adopt Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as part of the strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides.

New technology with genetic engineering, which is increasing the possibility to improve crop varieties more resistant to pests and diseases as well as drought conditions, has to be embraced alongside new ways of applying pesticides and automation in a digital era.

Attention was directed at providing advice to farmers in delivering methodology for protecting the environment by Robert Sheasby, formerly with the National Farmers Union (NFU), but now at the Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC), which represents 210 members ranging from small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) to large multinational organisations.

T1  - Fracking the Future: The Temporal Portability of Frames in Political Contests
AN  - 2350268431
AB  - Despite scientific consensus on the need to rapidly decarbonize economic systems to limit global warming, the exploitation of fossil fuels continues unabated. This begs the question, why do we continue down this path? We argue that one reason is the way in which fossil fuel expansion is temporally framed. In this article, we examine the disputed development of hydraulic fracturing of shale gas (‘fracking’) in the United Kingdom. Through analysis of a series of public inquiries conducted by the UK Government we show how industry, government and NGOs have engaged in a framing contest in debating the future of fracking. The findings show how the framing of fossil fuel development was solidified over time through processes of certainty, simplicity and familiarity. We contribute by: (a) showing how actors mobilize temporality in constructing persuasive and actionable frames; (b) developing a theory of how frames gain temporal portability – a chronology between a dominant past and a recognized future; and (c) providing an alternative theory of short-termism in explaining the path leading us to a dangerous climate changed future.

This is based on research carried out since 2017 but there have been political and legal developments which bring the issue to the fore now, chiefly these are concerned with Brexit and the EU definition of animal sentience contained in the Lisbon Treaty.At time of writing, however, there could scarcely be less certainty about the likely final outcome of the United Kingdom’s endeavours to exit the European Union.

AB  - COVID-19 has impacted not only the health of citizens, but also the various factors that make up our society, living environments, and ecosystems. This pandemic has shown that future living will need to be agile and flexible to adapt to the various changes in needs of societal populations. Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoof’s ‘Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem’ (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the ‘Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE)’ framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens.

T1  - Networking Historic Environmental Standards to Address Modern Challenges for Sustainable Conservation in HBIM
AN  - 2630513893
AB  - Featured ApplicationFor optimizing the conservation planning and considerations for efficient refurbishment of early twentieth century public Buildings in the UK.AbstractAwareness of the logic and context of original (and subsequent) design priorities is critical to informing decisions relating to valorisation, repair, refurbishment, energy retrofit or re-use of built heritage. A key benefit of collating data through Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) should be to assist others facing similar challenges. Here, examples for sharing understanding of how components belong to a system are outlined in the context of a newly completed dataset of public library buildings in the UK funded by Andrew Carnegie, predominantly built between 1900 and 1914. Demands for the functionality and economy of public library buildings, coupled with the emergent standardisation of building components at the time, provide a specific condition with potential for further iteration to other buildings of the period or related typologies. The work highlights the urgency of providing cost-efficient knowledge sharing structures in an era of altered priorities with respect to energy use for modern heritage. We propose the means for mapping common features to network knowledge amongst stakeholders through relevant open source pathways. The results demonstrate that integrating geographic approaches to knowledge sharing in HBIM with environmental considerations also supports wider questions of risk management related to the stewardship of historic buildings in the context of climate change.

T1  - Nature-Based Interventions and Mind–Body Interventions: Saving Public Health Costs Whilst Increasing Life Satisfaction and Happiness
AN  - 2630513812
AB  - A number of countries have begun to adopt prevention pays policies and practices to reduce pressure on health and social care systems. Most affluent countries have seen substantial increases in the incidence and costs of non-communicable diseases. The interest in social models for health has led to the growth in use of social prescribing and psychological therapies. At the same time, there has been growth in application of a variety of nature-based and mind–body interventions (NBIs and MBIs) aimed at improving health and longevity. We assess four NBI/MBI programmes (woodland therapy, therapeutic horticulture, ecotherapy/green care, and tai chi) on life satisfaction/happiness and costs of use of public services. These interventions produce rises in life satisfaction/happiness of 1.00 pts to 7.29 (n = 644; p < 0.001) (for courses or participation >50 h). These increases are greater than many positive life events (e.g., marriage or a new child); few countries or cities see +1 pt increases over a decade. The net present economic benefits per person from reduced public service use are £830–£31,520 (after 1 year) and £6450–£11,980 (after 10 years). We conclude that NBIs and MBIs can play a role in helping to reduce the costs on health systems, while increasing the well-being of participants.

AN  - 2566422669
AB  - This paper traces the history of local government in England (as opposed to the United Kingdom) since the early nineteenth century, and explores five long-term trends in its evolution. These are path dependence; the occurrence of major structural change; the phenomenon of policy reversal; the treatment of urban areas; and resistance to regional government. The author concludes that throughout the period under study, policy towards local government has exhibited a ‘pendulum effect’, with two opposing emphases operating in a sequential, rather than a simultaneous manner.

T1  - Analysis of the Circular Economic Production Models and Their Approach in Agriculture and Agricultural Waste Biomass Management
AN  - 2562165154
AB  - As of now, circular economic production models of the circular economy (CEPMs), which include circular economy, bioeconomy, and circular bioeconomy, are among the main tools characterizing development policies in different countries. During the last five years, policies and strategies regarding CEPMs have promoted and contributed to the development of research on this topic. The evolution and most relevant aspects of the three CEPMs previously mentioned have been analyzed from a sample of 2190 scientific publications obtained from the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis has been used to evaluate the approach of these models in agriculture and to introduce the ways in which they address the management of agricultural waste biomass (AWB). Results show that the circular economy is the most studied and prioritized model in China and most European countries, with the UK leading the way. Germany leads in topics related to the bioeconomy. The management policies and strategies of the circular bioeconomy are key to promoting research focused on AWB valorization since bioenergy and/or biofuel production continue to be a priority.

T1  - Degradation Cost Analysis of Li-Ion Batteries in the Capacity Market with Different Degradation Models
AN  - 2548447554
AB  - Increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy plants raises concerns about energy security and energy affordability. Capacity markets (CMs) have been implemented to provide investment stability to generators and secure energy generation by reducing the number of shortage hours. The research presented in this paper contributes to answering the question of whether batteries can provide cost effective back up services for one year in this market. The analysis uses an equivalent circuit lithium ion battery model coupled with two degradation models (empirical and semi-empirical) to account for capacity fade during battery lifetime. Depending on the battery’s output power, four de-rating factors of 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h are considered to study which de-rating strategy can result in best economic profit. Two scenarios for the number of shortage hours per year in the CM are predicted based on the energy demand data of Great Britain and recent research. Results show that the estimated battery profit is maximum with 2 h and 1 h de-rating factors and minimum with 4 h and 0.5 h. Depending on the battery degradation model used, battery degradation cost can considerably impact the potential profit if the battery’s temperature is not controlled with adequate thermal management system. The empirical and semi-empirical models predict that the degradation cost is minimum at 5 °C and 25 °C respectively. Moreover, both models predict degradation is minimum at lower battery charge levels. While the battery’s capacity fade can be minimized to make some profits from the CM service, the increased shortage hours can make providing this service not economically viable.

T1  - New insights into the genetic diversity of the stone crayfish: taxonomic and conservation implications
AN  - 2546713662
AB  - Background
Austropotamobius torrentium is a freshwater crayfish species native to central and south-eastern Europe, with an intricate evolutionary history and the highest genetic diversity recorded in the northern-central Dinarides (NCD). Its populations are facing declines, both in number and size across its entire range. By extanding current knowledge on the genetic diversity of this species, we aim to assist conservation programmes. Multigene phylogenetic analyses were performed using different divergence time estimates based on mitochondrial and, for the first time, nuclear DNA markers on the largest data set analysed so far. In order to reassess taxonomic relationships within this species we applied several species delimitation methods and studied the meristic characters with the intention of finding features that would clearly separate stone crayfish belonging to different phylogroups.
Results
Our results confirmed the existence of high genetic diversity within A. torrentium, maintained in divergent phylogroups which have their own evolutionary dynamics. A new phylogroup in the Kordun region belonging to NCD has also been discovered. Due to the incongruence between implemented species delimitation approaches and the lack of any morphological characters conserved within lineages, we are of the opinion that phylogroups recovered on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are cryptic subspecies and distinct evolutionary significant units.
Conclusions
Geographically and genetically isolated phylogroups represent the evolutionary legacy of A. torrentium and are highly relevant for conservation due to their evolutionary distinctiveness and restricted distribution.

T1  - Is Twitter Indicating a Change in MP’s Views on Climate Change?
AN  - 2469956481
AB  - Following the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 °C Special Report in October 2018, there has been a surge in public concern about climate change and demands for greater government action. We analyse the discourse of Members of Parliament (MPs) on climate change on Twitter to examine the extent to which these recent public climate-related events have influenced political agenda-setting. We argue that these events have had two, linked, effects: increased political discourse on climate change, and an increasing use of ‘urgent’ climate language. However, the language style used between political parties differs. Additionally, while the youth strikes and Greta Thunberg, who initiated these strikes, appear to have the greatest influence on MPs’ discourse, the overall relative impact is low, with responses predominately from left- and centrist-political parties. This indicates a clear difference between parties. However, Twitter may not be a suitable platform for investigating Conservative discourse. Further work to explore agenda-setting on Conservative policymaking is required.

T1  - People’s Attitude to Energy from Hydrogen—From the Point of View of Modern Energy Technologies and Social Responsibility
AN  - 2469696934
AB  - Energy from hydrogen is an appropriate technological choice in the context of sustainable development. The opportunities offered by the use of energy from hydrogen also represent a significant challenge for mobile technologies and daily life. Nevertheless, despite a significant amount of research and information regarding the benefits of hydrogen energy, it creates considerable controversy in many countries. Globally, there is a lack of understanding about the production process of hydrogen energy and the benefits it provides, which leads to concerns regarding the consistency of its use. In this study, an original questionnaire was used as a research tool to determine the opinions of inhabitants of countries in which hydrogen energy is underutilized and where the infrastructure for hydrogen energy is underdeveloped. Respondents presented their attitude to ecology, and indicated their knowledge regarding the operation of hydrogen energy and the use of hydrogen fuel. The results indicate that society is not convinced that the safety levels for energy derived from hydrogen are adequate. It can be concluded that knowledge about hydrogen as an energy source, and the production safety and storage methods of hydrogen, is very low. Negative attitudes to hydrogen energy can be an important barrier in the development of this energy in many countries.

T1  - Environmental factors associated with general practitioner consultations for allergic rhinitis in London, England: a retrospective time series analysis
AN  - 2467287496
AB  - ObjectivesTo identify key predictors of general practitioner (GP) consultations for allergic rhinitis (AR) using meteorological and environmental data.DesignA retrospective, time series analysis of GP consultations for AR.SettingA large GP surveillance network of GP practices in the London area.ParticipantsThe study population was all persons who presented to general practices in London that report to the Public Health England GP in-hours syndromic surveillance system during the study period (3 April 2012 to 11 August 2014).Primary measureConsultations for AR (numbers of consultations).ResultsDuring the study period there were 186 401 GP consultations for AR. High grass and nettle pollen counts (combined) were associated with the highest increases in consultations (for the category 216-270 grains/m3, relative risk (RR) 3.33, 95% CI 2.69 to 4.12) followed by high tree (oak, birch and plane combined) pollen counts (for the category 260–325 grains/m3, RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.15) and average daily temperatures between 15°C and 20°C (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.81). Higher levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) appeared to be associated with increased consultations (for the category 70–85 µg/m3, RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71), but a significant effect was not found with ozone. Higher daily rainfall was associated with fewer consultations (15–20 mm/day; RR 0.812, 95% CI 0.674 to 0.980).ConclusionsChanges in grass, nettle or tree pollen counts, temperatures between 15°C and 20°C, and (to a lesser extent) NO2 concentrations were found to be associated with increased consultations for AR. Rainfall has a negative effect. In the context of climate change and continued exposures to environmental air pollution, intelligent use of these data will aid targeting public health messages and plan healthcare demand.

T1  - Opportunities and Limitations of Building Energy Performance Simulation Tools in the Early Stages of Building Design in the UK
AN  - 2463892408
AB  - This research investigates the use of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) tools in the early stages of building design in UK architectural practices with a particular focus on the barriers and opportunities to their effective application and further uptake. Two primary methods of investigation were undertaken; the first was a wide survey among UK architects and architectural practices, where the responses of 418 participants were electronically gathered and analysed. A deeper understanding of the issues was developed through an analysis of the process of low-energy building design using semi-structured interviews with six representatives of well-established architectural practices in the UK. The findings reveal that while there is an increasing understanding of the importance of BEPS involvement at the early design stages, there was limited evidence of actual early implementation of BEPS tools other than a few well known but specialised tools such as Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) which were used mainly for domestic energy performance evaluation. However, many practices surveyed showed interest in achieving higher standards than the “basic” regulatory backstops, which has resulted in Passive House and BREEAM seeing increasing use in domestic and non-domestic projects respectively. Although there has been a significant increase in the development and availability of tools and methodologies for assessing building energy performance our study shows that the focus for future research needs to be shifted from the “tool development” to looking at methods of implementing and using such tools in practice at the early design stages.

T1  - Anne Bradstreet’s Family Plots: Puritanism, Humanism, Posthumanism
AN  - 2462152465
AB  - This article explores the interface between textuality and materiality—of bodies, things, and places—in Bradstreet’s writings, an intersection where Bradstreet resists and revises the spiritual metaphors of the male coterie within which she produced and published her poems, turning them instead toward living engagements with place. Focusing on her poem “Contemplations” and the manuscript writings in the “Andover Manuscript,” I argue that Bradstreet’s sustained involvement with the local, immediate, material world grafts Puritanism’s spiritual and spatial allegories to the physical actualities of place, with results that trouble and decenter their univocal force. Reintroducing materiality into a reading of Bradstreet’s works, I contend, brings realignment of orthodoxy to originality to the fore.
This project pursues three aims. First, I wish to bring critical attention to the “Andover Manuscript” (Harvard MS AM 1007.1), a largely unexamined work containing a holograph collection of seventy-seven “Meditations Diuine and morall” and a “Book by Any yet unread,” composed in prose and poetry, and copied by Bradstreet’s son after her death. Second, I pursue a reintroduction of materiality into the study of women’s writing in order to demonstrate the benefit of new materialist critique to readings of early modern women’s writing. By both defining and deploying this method, I recover an archive that takes into account matter as existing beyond text. Finally, I respond to the bifurcated critical reception of Bradstreet’s works, which has tended to draw a line between the “private” manuscript writings and the “political” poems of The Tenth Muse. I argue that it is not the medium of Bradstreet’s writings—manuscript or print—that determines her relative publicity or privacy, conformity or challenge. Rather, I encourage a shift in focus to consider materiality, not only of the book but more broadly of its author and environment, arguing that a reading grounded in the physical actualities of place can unite these polarized views.

T1  - New insights into the genetic diversity of the stone crayfish: taxonomic and conservation implications
AN  - 2461820747
AB  - Background 
Austropotamobius torrentium is a freshwater crayfish species native to central and south-eastern Europe, with an intricate evolutionary history and the highest genetic diversity recorded in the northern-central Dinarides (NCD). Its populations are facing declines, both in number and size across its entire range. By extanding current knowledge on the genetic diversity of this species, we aim to assist conservation programmes. Multigene phylogenetic analyses were performed using different divergence time estimates based on mitochondrial and, for the first time, nuclear DNA markers on the largest data set analysed so far. In order to reassess taxonomic relationships within this species we applied several species delimitation methods and studied the meristic characters with the intention of finding features that would clearly separate stone crayfish belonging to different phylogroups.
 Results 
Our results confirmed the existence of high genetic diversity within A. torrentium, maintained in divergent phylogroups which have their own evolutionary dynamics. A new phylogroup in the Kordun region belonging to NCD has also been discovered. Due to the incongruence between implemented species delimitation approaches and the lack of any morphological characters conserved within lineages, we are of the opinion that phylogroups recovered on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are cryptic subspecies and distinct evolutionary significant units.
 Conclusions 
Geographically and genetically isolated phylogroups represent the evolutionary legacy of A. torrentium and are highly relevant for conservation due to their evolutionary distinctiveness and restricted distribution.

Behavioural science can play a critical role in combatting the effects of an infectious disease outbreak or public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The current paper presents a synthesis of review literature discussing the application of behaviour change theories within an infectious disease and emergency response context, with a view to informing infectious disease modelling, research and public health practice.
 Methods 
A scoping review procedure was adopted for the searches. Searches were run on PubMed, PsychInfo and Medline with search terms covering four major categories: behaviour, emergency response (e.g., infectious disease, preparedness, mass emergency), theoretical models, and reviews. Three further top-up reviews was also conducted using Google Scholar. Papers were included if they presented a review of theoretical models as applied to understanding preventative health behaviours in the context of emergency preparedness and response, and/or infectious disease outbreaks.
 Results 
Thirteen papers were included in the final synthesis. Across the reviews, several theories of behaviour change were identified as more commonly cited within this context, specifically, Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Protection Motivation Theory, with support (although not universal) for their effectiveness in this context. Furthermore, the application of these theories in previous primary research within this context was found to be patchy, and so further work is required to systematically incorporate and test behaviour change models within public health emergency research and interventions.
 Conclusion 
Overall, this review identifies a range of more commonly applied theories with broad support for their use within an infectious disease and emergency response context. The Discussion section details several key recommendations to help researchers, practitioners, and infectious disease modellers to incorporate these theories into their work. Specifically, researchers and practitioners should base future research and practice on a systematic application of theories, beginning with those reported herein. Furthermore, infectious disease modellers should consult the theories reported herein to ensure that the full range of relevant constructs (cognitive, emotional and social) are incorporated into their models. In all cases, consultation with behavioural scientists throughout these processes is strongly recommended to ensure the appropriate application of theory.

T1  - Prognostics and Health Management for the Optimization of Marine Hybrid Energy Systems
AN  - 2441918419
AB  - Decarbonization of marine transport is a key global issue, with the carbon emissions of international shipping projected to increase 23% to 1090 million tonnes by 2035 in comparison to 2015 levels. Optimization of the energy system (especially propulsion system) in these vessels is a complex multi-objective challenge involving economical maintenance, environmental metrics, and energy demand requirements. In this paper, data from instrumented vessels on the River Thames in London, which includes environmental emissions, power demands, journey patterns, and variance in operational patterns from the captain(s) and loading (passenger numbers), is integrated and analyzed through automatic, multi-objective global optimization to create an optimal hybrid propulsion configuration for a hybrid vessel. We propose and analyze a number of computational techniques, both for monitoring and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of individual energy assets, as well as modeling and optimization of energy use scenarios of a hybrid-powered vessel. Our multi-objective optimization relates to emissions, asset health, and power performance. We show that, irrespective of the battery packs used, our Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is able to achieve over 92% accuracy in remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is proposed for prognostics of state of charge (SOC) of back-up lead-acid batteries. The classifier achieved an average of 95.5% accuracy in a three-fold cross validation. Utilizing operational data from the vessel, optimal autonomous propulsion strategies are modeled combining the use of battery and diesel engines. The experiment results show that 70% to 80% of fuel saving can be achieved when the diesel engine is operated up to 350 kW. Our methodology has demonstrated the feasibility of combination of artificial intelligence (AI) methods and real world data in decarbonization and optimization of green technologies for maritime propulsion.

T1  - Women in Environmental Sciences (WiES) and The UN SDGs: A Catalyst for Achieving a Sustainable Future for All
AN  - 2440246282
AB  - Women can serve as catalysts needed to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development agenda by 2030. The Women in Environmental Sciences network engaged women from culturally and professionally diverse backgrounds at two workshops held in the UK in 2018 and 2019. The interdisciplinary environmental sciences’ meeting included presentations by leading women in academic and non-academic organizations. Through breakout sessions, effective interaction, and discussions between professionals and grassroots, an atmosphere of “leaving no one behind” was created. Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 55 years and more than 65% of the participants were under 35 years old, representing the productive working group. The mixed group of young and the old, academic and non-academic women provided a basis for insightful and lively discussions needed to bridge the gap between information disseminated to professionals and non-professionals, to students, and early career researchers. In this article, the following information are presented: Relevant literature in view of gender equality and environmental aspects, summary of the talks and discussions, how the talks aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and sub-targets, issues identified and avenues for change, evaluation and some quotations from the participants. The article showcases the opportunity for the implementation of SDGs in all organizations through the promotion of integrated discussions on environmental science aspects, gender, equality, diversity, inclusion, partnerships needed to inform effective policy changes at local, national, or global levels. This article provides insights to professionals/non-professionals, governmental, non-governmental organizations, higher education institutions, and local communities and women. By providing a summary of the talks and their alignment with SDGs, the Women in Environmental Sciences provide new ways of engagement required at these times to develop applied and strategic research, and open a dimension of how the SDGs can be implemented to cope with changing environmental conditions.

T1  - Lean Management Framework for Healthcare Facilities Integrating BIM, BEPS and Big Data Analytics
AN  - 2439556004
AB  - An increase in the usage of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Facility Management (FM) induces a huge data stack. Even though these data bring opportunities such as cost savings, time savings, increase in user comfort, space optimization, energy savings, inventory management, etc., these data sources cannot be managed and manipulated effectively to increase efficiency at the FM stage. In addition to data management issues, FM practices, or developed solutions, need to be supported with the implementation of lean management philosophy to reveal organizational and managerial wastes. In the literature, some researchers performed studies about awareness about building information modeling (BIM)-FM, and FM-related data management problems in terms of lean philosophy. However, the comprehensive solution for effective FM has not been investigated with the application of lean management philosophy yet. Therefore, this study aims to develop an FM framework for healthcare facilities by considering lean management philosophy since more stable workflow, continuous improvement, and creating more value to customers will help to deliver a more acceptable solution for the FM industry. Within this context, the integration of BIM, Building Energy Performance Simulations, and Big Data Analytics are proposed as a solution. In the study, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was followed to develop the FM framework. Depending on the DSR methodology, two scenarios were used to investigate the issue in a real healthcare facility and develop the FM framework. The developed framework was evaluated by four experts, and the revisions of the proposed framework were realized.

T1  - Assessment of the Renewable Energy Sector Performance Using Selected Indicators in European Union Countries
AN  - 2438844499
AB  - Renewable energy is the key pillar and plays an important role in the energy systems of European Union member states and in mitigating climate change. It is supporting the transition towards a greener, resource-efficient and more competitive, low-carbon European Union economy. Above-average, average and below-average values of monitored indicators in member states of the European Union in 2009–2016 were ascertained by using principal component analysis. Monitored indicators of the renewable energy sector included electricity generation, electricity capacity, investments of public financial institutions, number of employees and turnover achieved from the economic activities related to production, distribution, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment (all of them per capita). Based on the achieved results, we can state that the situation changed during the period under review. Member states have moved between above-average, average and below-average levels of renewable energy indicators. However, a lack of change in the indicators was recorded in some member states throughout the eight-year period (Finland, France, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Spain did not move significantly). Renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal and energy from biomass) were evaluated as a whole due to different natural, economic and legislative conditions of European Union countries.

T1  - Indicadores compuestos como metodología innovadora en Comunicación. Aplicación para la evaluación de los medios públicos europeos
TT  - Composite indicators as an innovative methodology for Communication Sciences. Implementation for the assessment of European public service media
AN  - 2437758866
AB  - El modelo de producción científica actualmente dominante en el área de Comunicación presenta un exceso de estandarización de las investigaciones, principalmente empíricas, que se llevan a cabo de un modo abrumador mayoritariamente con técnicas cuantitativas basadas en análisis estadísticos simples que, en muchos casos, limitan la exposición de resultados a una lectura de los datos disponibles. Se plantea una propuesta innovadora en el área que se diseña a modo de nueva forma de diseminación y exposición científica. El objetivo es la construcción de tres indicadores compuestos que al ser aplicados a los medios de comunicación públicos europeos permitirán medir la percepción de su valor social, su independencia y eficiencia de gestión. Se plantea, además, como un estudio que permita una visión comparativa de estos tres aspectos en todos los países de la Unión Europea, excepto Malta y Luxemburgo1. La metodología innova porque explica detalladamente el proceso y justifica la validez de las fuentes documentales empleadas para facilitar su réplica o cuestionamiento. Refuerza la discusión de los resultados obtenidos con la evaluación de robustez de los indicadores creados, antes de decidir cada vez cuál es el indicador más adecuado comparando los resultados con una técnica de análisis de decisión multicriterio, el método Topsis (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution), propuesto por Hwang y Yoon (1981). Los resultados acreditan que los indicadores sintéticos constituyen una herramienta metodológica innovadora, original y validable que puede contribuir al avance de la investigación en Comunicación.Alternate abstract: The currently dominant model of scientific production in the field of communications research exhibits an over standardization of mainly empirical research, which is overwhelmingly carried out using quantitative techniques based on simple statistical analysis, in many cases limiting the presented results to an interpretation of the available data. This paper presents an innovative proposal in the field, designed as a new strategy for scientific dissemination and presentation. It puts forward the objective of building three composite indicators that, applied to European public service media, will allow the assessment of the perception of their social value, independence, and management efficiency. Moreover, a study that enables a comparative vision of these three issues in all the countries of the European Union, excluding Malta and Luxemburg, is also proposed. This methodology represents an innovation because it thoroughly explains the process and justifies the validity of the documentary sources used to facilitate their reproduction or questioning. It also reinforces the discussion of the results with the evaluation of the indicators’ robustness before deciding which of them is most appropriate on each occasion for comparing the results using a multicriteria decision analysis technique, the Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (Topis) method, proposed by Hwang and Yoon (1981). The results attest that synthetic indicators are an innovative, original, and validatable methodological tool that can contribute to the progress of research in the field of the communications sciences.

T1  - Green Infrastructures in the Peri-Urban Landscape: Exploring Local Perception of Well-Being through ‘Go-Alongs’ and ‘Semi-Structured Interviews’
AN  - 2437713842
AB  - Providing conditions for health and well-being, especially for those most exposed to social and environmental inequalities, is a precondition for sustainable development. Green infrastructures in peri-urban areas have the potential to improve the quality of life of locals by fostering healthy practices, providing views, or bringing nature closer to the city. This work explores the local perception of well-being within urban green infrastructures (UGI) in the peri-urban fringe of Madrid (Spain) through a combination of qualitative methods: “go-alongs” and “semi-structured static interviews”. The grounded-theory based codification of the data using NVivo software and their subsequent analysis results in the identification of social, natural, and perceptual elements that prove to play a relevant role in locals’ perception of well-being. Among these, connectivity with other green spaces, panoramic views and place-based memories are aspects that seem to make UGI serve the community at its full potential, including perceived physical and psychological well-being. We identify in each case study both positive characteristics of UGI and dysfunctional aspects and areas of opportunity. Lastly, a methodological, geographical, and theoretical discussion is made on the relevance of the case studies and pertinence of the two interview methods as valuable tools for analysis and intervention in the peri-urban landscape.

T1  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Assessing the Contribution of Higher Education Programmes
AN  - 2436331719
AB  - Universities are engines of societal transformation and can nurture future citizens and navigate them towards sustainability through their educational programmes. Here, we developed an assessment framework for educational institutions to evaluate the contribution of their educational programmes to sustainability by reviewing the alignment of their intended learning outcomes to the enabling conditions for a vision of sustainability based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The tool is based on a systemic grouping of the SDGs into eight sustainability attributes, namely, Safe Operating Space, Just Operating Space, Resilient Sustainable Behaviours, Alternative Economic Models, Health and Wellbeing, Collaboration, Diversity and Inclusion, and Transparency and Governance, and uses a word code developed specifically for each sustainability attribute to assess the coverage of the SDGs in master’s programmes’ learning outcomes. The tool uses multi-criteria analysis to compare and rank programmes according to the alignment of their learning outcomes to the sustainability attributes and their contribution to sustainability. It was first tested using data from a University’s eighteen master’s programmes on a range of subjects and subsequently applied to compare forty UK and European master’s programmes focusing on environment and sustainability. Findings demonstrate that even environmental programmes face some important gaps related to health, wellbeing, diversity, inclusion, and collaboration, amongst others, and reinforce the need for all universities to understand the contribution of their programmes to sustainability. The application of the tool can generate empirical evidence on the effectiveness of university programmes and establish a strong argument regarding the potential of education as a tool for achieving the SDGs.

T1  - Edible Green Infrastructure for Urban Regeneration and Food Security: Case Studies from the Campania Region
AN  - 2435310015
AB  - Ten identified edible green infrastructure (EGI)-related urban regeneration case studies within the Campania region, Italy, are explored in relation to local community development, involvement, and education. Urban space and agriculture are promoted as sustainably planned networks for edible food components and structures. Within an urban ecosystem, city planners are actively promoting urban agriculture after an increase in the availability of unused land. Advantages for public health include stress reduction and physical activity, as well as sustainability of urban gardens by way of far-sighted urban planning. Case studies within the Campania region illustrate EGI know-hows and awareness, and they elucidate upon a number of beneficial reasons for its implementation. Within the Campania region, all five provinces showed positive impacts when using EGI for urban regeneration and well-being. Recent developments from the COVID-19 pandemic are reinforcing a rethink of food security and food supply chains.

T1  - A Decentralized Informatics, Optimization, and Control Framework for Evolving Demand Response Services
AN  - 2434631632
AB  - This paper presents a decentralized informatics, optimization, and control framework to enable demand response (DR) in small or rural decentralized community power systems, including geographical islands. The framework consists of a simplified lumped model for electrical demand forecasting, a scheduling subsystem that optimizes the utility of energy storage assets, and an active/pro-active control subsystem. The active control strategy provides secondary DR services, through optimizing a multi-objective cost function formulated using a weight-based routing algorithm. In this context, the total weight of each edge between any two consecutive nodes is calculated as a function of thermal comfort, cost (tariff), and the rate at which electricity is consumed over a short future time horizon. The pro-active control strategy provides primary DR services. Furthermore, tertiary DR services can be processed to initiate a sequence of operations that enables the continuity of applied electrical services for the duration of the demand side event. Computer simulations and a case study using hardware-in-the-loop testing is used to evaluate the optimization and control module. The main conclusion drawn from this research shows the real-time operation of the proposed optimization and control scheme, operating on a prototype platform, underpinned by the effectiveness of the new methods and approach for tackling the optimization problem. This research recommends deployment of the optimization and control scheme, at scale, for decentralized community energy management. The paper concludes with a short discussion of business aspects and outlines areas for future work.

T1  - Verifying the Utility of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in the Reclamation of a Lignite Combustion Waste Disposal Site in Central European Conditions
AN  - 2434362203
AB  - N-fixing tree species, such as black locust, have achieved very promising results in the reclamation of technosols, especially those at combustion waste disposal sites, which have extremely poor nutrients and adverse physicochemical parameters. This paper presents an assessment of the survival rates, growth parameters, and quality and vitality of and nutrient supply (NPK) to black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) specimens that were experimentally planted on a lignite combustion waste disposal site. The black locust seedlings were introduced directly into the combustion waste using two variants of NPK (7% N, 5.5% P2O5, and 9% K2O) fertilisation, at doses of 250 and 500 kg ha−1, and in control plots with no mineral fertilisation. No significant impacts of the applied mineral fertilisation were found on the soil properties, growth parameters, or nutrient supplies to the trees. Black locust introduced to the landfill after three years of revegetation was characterised by a very high survival rate of 95%–100%, as well as good growth parameters (height and diameter at the root collar). Nutrient supply was determined on the basis of the chemical composition of the leaves, which indicated an adequate supply of nitrogen, similar to levels found under natural conditions. In the case of K and P, the supply levels were lower than optimal when compared with data from the literature. However, at this initial stage of tree development on the combustion waste disposal site, nutrient supply is similar on all variants and is not a critical factor for successful black locust introduction. We suggest using growth parameters, survival, and vitality of trees as decisive factors for the reclamation of combustion waste landfill sites strategy. All these factors confirmed the usefulness of black locust to the reclamation of combustion waste disposal sites.

T1  - Assessment of the Impact of Electric Vehicles on the Design and Effectiveness of Electric Distribution Grid with Distributed Generation
AN  - 2429335076
AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the probable effect that electric vehicles (EVs), already in wide circulation and likely to increase exponentially in the near future, will have on distribution networks. Analyses are conducted on the necessary interventions and evolutions that the distribution grid will have to undergo in order to manage this new and progressively increasing heavy load of energy. Thus, in order to understand the technical limitations of the current infrastructure and how transformers and lines will be able to withstand the increasing penetration of EVs, urban and rural grid models have been studied, to highlight the differences between the impacts on high- and low-density networks. In addition, an analysis of fast charging station impact has been carried out. MATLAB software was used to perform the simulations for the creation of scripts, which were then exploited within the DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. This allowed evaluation of the networks under examination and verification of the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. In concluding based on findings, some methods of managing the distribution network to optimise the network parameters analysed in the study and a solution involving electric vehicles are recommended.

T1  - A Critical Review of Wind Power Forecasting Methods—Past, Present and Future
AN  - 2427195428
AB  - The largest obstacle that suppresses the increase of wind power penetration within the power grid is uncertainties and fluctuations in wind speeds. Therefore, accurate wind power forecasting is a challenging task, which can significantly impact the effective operation of power systems. Wind power forecasting is also vital for planning unit commitment, maintenance scheduling and profit maximisation of power traders. The current development of cost-effective operation and maintenance methods for modern wind turbines benefits from the advancement of effective and accurate wind power forecasting approaches. This paper systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches of wind power forecasting with regard to physical, statistical (time series and artificial neural networks) and hybrid methods, including factors that affect accuracy and computational time in the predictive modelling efforts. Besides, this study provided a guideline for wind power forecasting process screening, allowing the wind turbine/farm operators to identify the most appropriate predictive methods based on time horizons, input features, computational time, error measurements, etc. More specifically, further recommendations for the research community of wind power forecasting were proposed based on reviewed literature.

T1  - Dietary Selenium Intakes and Musculoskeletal Function in Very Old Adults: Analysis of the Newcastle 85+ Study
AN  - 2424273956
AB  - Background: Selenium is a trace element essential for health. Severe selenium deficiencies are associated with poor musculoskeletal (MSK) function. However, the effects of moderate deficiency on MSK function, especially in older adults, is unclear. Objectives: To determine the associations between selenium intake and MSK function in very old adults. Methods: Selenium intake at baseline and, hand-grip strength (HGS) and timed-up-and-go (TUG) at four phases over 5 years, were available in 791 participants in the Newcastle 85+ Study, a community-based, longitudinal cohort of ≥ 85 year old individuals. We investigated relationships between selenium intake and HGS and TUG in cross-sectional analyses at baseline using multivariate analyses and, prospectively using linear mixed models to explore HGS and TUG changes over 5 years in association with baseline selenium intake. Results: At baseline, 53% of participants had selenium intakes that were classified as low. These individuals had 2.80 kg lower HGS and were 2.30 s slower performing the TUG, cross-sectionally. In multivariate, baseline analyses, selenium intake had no significant impact on HGS or TUG. Selenium intake had no significant effect on MSK function, prospectively. Conclusion: Low selenium intake is common among very old adults and, in cross-sectional analyses, is associated with poorer MSK function.

T1  - Analyses of Hybrid Viability across a Hybrid Zone between Two Alnus Species Using Microsatellites and cpDNA Markers
AN  - 2423583331
AB  - Diploid Alnus glutinosa s. str. and autotetraploid A. rohlenae form a narrow hybrid zone in a study area in southern Serbia, which results in triploid hybrid formation. The vast majority of previous studies have been focused on studies of maternal plants, but the offspring resulting from their crossing have not been much studied. Here, we use the variability of microsatellites and chloroplast DNA between these species and their putative hybrids to create an overall picture of the development of the hybrid zone and its predicted type. To elucidate the gene transfer within both species, the origins of individual ploidies and especially the role of triploid hybrids, a germination experiment was carried out linked with a flow cytometry study of the resulting seedlings. The tension zone model seems to offer the most adequate explanation of our observations, with selection against triploid hybrids and the spatial positioning of the hybrid zone. Despite selection against them, the triploid hybrids play an important role in the exchange of genes between the two species and therefore serve as a bridge for introgression. The presence of fertile triploids is essential for enriching the haplotype diversity between these species and for the development of new genetic lineages.

T1  - Repurposing Hydrocarbon Wells for Geothermal Use in the UK: The Onshore Fields with the Greatest Potential
AN  - 2423358619
AB  - One potential opportunity for the decarbonisation of heat supply in the UK is the repurposing of onshore hydrocarbon wells for the production and/or storage of geothermal heat. This paper reports an investigation into the most favourable candidate sites for such repurposing, taking into consideration the available thermal energy outputs and technological options for heat use. A GIS mapping model was generated, combining public domain data on onshore wells and production data from onshore fields, provided by the UK Oil and Gas Authority, with available subsurface temperature data. This model has thus integrated information on location, depth, operational status, and bottom-hole temperature for onshore hydrocarbon wells with production rates from onshore fields in the UK. Of the 2242 onshore hydrocarbon wells thus reported, 560 have the potential to be repurposed, 292 of which are currently operating. Using aggregated water production data for all operating wells in each field, the fields with the greatest potential for geothermal repurposing are ranked. Two of these, the Wytch Farm and Wareham fields, are selected for more detailed analysis. Wytch Farm, the largest onshore oilfield in western Europe, produces water at ~65 °C that might yield a feasible thermal power output of ~90 MW. If an end use could be found where it might substitute for burning of natural gas, the value of this output would be ~£90,000 per day or ~£30 million per year. However, this field is located in a protected landscape where local development would be restricted by planning regulations. The Wareham field is not in a protected landscape, but the low temperature, ~44 °C, and low flow rate limit the scope of potential end uses. Nonetheless, these and the other highly ranked fields have potential heat outputs that are significant compared with other geothermal heat projects, thus offering the possibility of making useful contributions to the decarbonisation of UK energy use.

T1  - Demand Response Model Development for Smart Households Using Time of Use Tariffs and Optimal Control—The Isle of Wight Energy Autonomous Community Case Study
AN  - 2422315323
AB  - Residential variable energy price schemes can be made more effective with the use of a demand response (DR) strategy along with smart appliances. Using DR, the electricity bill of participating customers/households can be minimised, while pursuing other aims such as demand-shifting and maximising consumption of locally generated renewable-electricity. In this article, a two-stage optimization method is used to implement a price-based implicit DR scheme. The model considers a range of novel smart devices/technologies/schemes, connected to smart-meters and a local DR-Controller. A case study with various decarbonisation scenarios is used to analyse the effects of deploying the proposed DR-scheme in households located in the west area of the Isle of Wight (Southern United Kingdom). There are approximately 15,000 households, of which 3000 are not connected to the gas-network. Using a distribution network model along with a load flow software-tool, the secondary voltages and apparent-power through transformers at the relevant substations are computed. The results show that in summer, participating households could export up to 6.4 MW of power, which is 10% of installed large-scale photovoltaics (PV) capacity on the island. Average carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) reductions of 7.1 ktons/annum and a reduction in combined energy/transport fuel-bills of 60%/annum could be achieved by participating households.

T1  - Technoeconomic Analysis on a Hybrid Power System for the UK Household Using Renewable Energy: A Case Study
AN  - 2417715800
AB  - The United Kingdom has abundant renewable energy resources from wind, solar, biomass and others. Meanwhile, domestic sector consumes large amount of electricity and natural gas. This paper aims to explore the potentials of a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) to supply power and heat for a household with the optimal configuration. A typical house in the United Kingdom is selected as a case study and its energy consumption is collected and analysed. Based on energy demands of the house, a distributed HRES including wind turbine, solar photovoltaic (PV) and biogas genset is designed and simulated to satisfy the power and heat demands. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Software is used to conduct this technoeconomic analysis. It is found that the HRES system with one 1-kW wind turbine, one 1-kW sized biogas genset, four battery units and one 1-kW sized power converter is the most feasible solution, which can supply enough power and heat to meet the household demands. In addition, the HRES system has the lowest net present cost (NPC) of $14,507 and the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.588 kW−1·h−1. The case study is also quite insightful to other European countries.

T1  - Flash Flood!: a SeriousGeoGames activity combining science festivals, video games, and virtual reality with research data for communicating flood risk and geomorphology
AN  - 2408496017
AB  - The risk of flooding around the world is large and increasing, yet in many areas there is still a difficulty in engaging the public with their own flood risk. Geomorphology is a science that is linked to flooding and can exacerbate risks, but awareness of the science with the public is low and declining within academia. To increase awareness, it is important to engage the public directly with the science and those who are working to reduce flood risks – this starts by inspiring people to seek out further information through positive experiences of the science and researchers. Here, a new design model is presented to engage the public with specific research projects by using useful components offered by the popular mediums of games, virtual reality (VR), and science festivals to allow the public to get “hands on” with research data and models: SeriousGeoGames. ASeriousGeoGames activity, Flash Flood!, was developed around real geomorphology survey data to help engage the public with a flood-risk-related research project by placing them in a river valley as it undergoes a geomorphically active flooding from an intense rainfall event. Flash Flood! was exhibited at two science-focussed events, and formal evaluation was captured using a short questionnaire, finding that the majority of audience had a positive interaction (95.1 %) and wanted to know more about flooding (68.0 %) and geomorphology (60.1 %). It is hoped these interactions will increase the likelihood that future engagements with relevant agencies will be more fruitful, especially when it matters most.

T1  - Impacts of River Engineering on River Channel Behaviour: Implications for Managing Downstream Flood Risk
AN  - 2403786272
AB  - Although knowledge of sediment transport has improved over the last 25 years, our understanding of bedload transfer and sediment delivery is still based on a limited set of observations or on models that make assumptions on hydraulic and sediment transport processes. This study utilises repeat lidar survey data of the River Caldew above the City of Carlisle in the UK to investigate the balance of erosion and deposition associated with channel switching from an engineered and managed single thread channel to a naturalising incipient wandering system. Over the 11-year survey period (four bankfull flood events) around 271,000 m3 of sediment were delivered to the river and floodplain and 197,000 m3 eroded suggesting that storage rates of around 7000 m3/annum occurred. The balance of erosion and deposition is influenced by channelisation with very restricted overbank sedimentation and only limited local and transient in-channel bar deposition along the engineered reach (8000 m3 eroded). This contrasts with the activity of the naturalising reach downstream where a developing wandering channel system is acting to store coarse sediment in-stream as large bar complexes and the associated upstream aggrading plane bed reaches and overbank as splay deposits (87,000 m3 stored). Such behavior suggests that naturalisation of channelised systems upstream of flood vulnerable urban areas can have a significant impact on sediment induced flooding downstream. This conclusion must, however, be moderated in the light of the relatively small volumes of material needed to instigate local aggradation in over-capacity urban channels.

T1  - A Prospective Net Energy and Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment of the UK Electricity Grid
AN  - 2399041119
AB  - National Grid, the UK’s largest utility company, has produced a number of energy transition scenarios, among which “2 degrees” is the most aggressive in terms of decarbonization. This paper presents the results of a combined prospective net energy and environmental life cycle assessment of the UK electricity grid, based on such a scenario. The main findings are that the strategy is effective at drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions (albeit to a reduced degree with respect to the projected share of “zero carbon” generation taken at face value), but it entails a trade-off in terms of depletion of metal resources. The grid’s potential toxicity impacts are also expected to remain substantially undiminished with respect to the present. Overall, the analysis indicates that the “2 degrees” scenario is environmentally sound and that it even leads to a modest increase in the net energy delivered to society by the grid (after accounting for the energy investments required to deploy all technologies).

T1  - More Timber in Construction: Unanswered Questions and Future Challenges
AN  - 2395483229
AB  - The built environment is one of the greatest contributors to carbon emissions, climate change, and to the unsustainable pressure on the natural environment and its ecosystems. The use of more timber in construction is one possible response, and an authoritative contribution to this growing movement comes from the UK’s Committee on Climate Change, which identifies a “substantial increase in the use of wood in the construction of buildings” as a top priority. However, a global encouragement of such a strategy raises some difficult questions. Given the urgency of effective solutions for low-carbon built environments, and the likely continued growth in demand for timber in construction, this article reviews its sustainability and identifies future challenges and unanswered questions. Existing evidence points indeed towards timber as the lower carbon option when modelled through life cycle assessment without having to draw on arguments around carbon storage. Issues however remain on the timing of carbon emissions, land allocation, and the environmental loads and benefits associated with the end-of-life options: analysis of environmental product declarations for engineered timber suggests that landfill might either be the best or the worst option from a climate change perspective, depending on assumptions.

T1  - How Bright Are the Prospects for UK Trade and Prosperity Post-Brexit?
AN  - 2390588140
AB  - So long as the UK government liberates itself from the protectionist mercantilist mindset of the European Union and reduces trade barriers after Brexit, and UK businesses respond positively to the challenge of increased international competition (through increased productivity and exports), the prospects for UK trade and prosperity post-Brexit are very bright indeed. The EU itself acknowledges that 90% of future growth in global gross domestic product will be outside the EU. The costs of remaining in the EU are very high and not all purely economic: the EU is no longer a force for global liberalisation. On the basis of both international and EU law, the monetary costs to the UK of leaving the EU should have been fairly low. Similarly, the frictional costs to both the UK and the EU of their post-Brexit trade relationship should also be low. However, as a consequence of both the concessions made by the UK in order to demonstrate its goodwill and the hard line taken by the EU in order to discourage other member states from leaving, these costs could well end up being much higher than they need be for both sides. Of particular concern is the EU's "level playing field" demand, laid out in the (albeit non-binding) Political Declaration for a future trading relationship. This would effectively prevent the UK from achieving regulatory autonomy or from pursuing an independent trade policy. The Treasury predicts a 7.7% reduction in GDP in the event of "no deal" in which the UK retained the existing Common External Tariff with the rest of the world and also imposed the same tariffs on trade with the EU. However, EU barriers on trade in food and manufactures raise their prices by 20%. By leaving the Customs Union and reducing these barriers from 20% to 10%, UK GDP would rise by 4%. By leaving the Single Market and avoiding the costs of meeting its excessive regulatory standards, UK GDP would rise by another 2%. The total increase in GDP of 6% is similar to the 5.4% increase in GDP following Australia's trade liberalisation in 1986. JEL codes: F13, F40, F59

T1  - Heat Decarbonisation Modelling Approaches in the UK: An Energy System Architecture Perspective
AN  - 2389963946
AB  - Energy models have been widely applied to the analysis of energy system decarbonisation to assess the options and costs of a transition to a low carbon supply. However, questions persist as to whether they are able to effectively represent and assess heat decarbonisation pathways for the buildings sector. A range of limitations have been identified, including a poor spatio-temporal resolution, limited representation of behaviour, and restricted representation of the full technical option set. This paper undertakes a review of existing energy models for heat decarbonisation in the UK, applying the novel perspective of energy system architecture (ESA). A set of ESA-related features are identified (including evolvability, flexibility, robustness, and feasibility), and models are reviewed against these features. The review finds that a range of models exist that have strengths across different features of ESA, suggesting that multiple modelling approaches are needed in order to adequately address the heat decarbonisation challenge. However, opportunities to improve existing models and develop new approaches also exist, and a research agenda is therefore proposed.

T1  - Undoing the Market: Corporate Sponsorship and Activist Protests at Tate Galleries
AN  - 2383520506
AB  - This article focuses on activist group Liberate Tate's online performance-based protests against BP's (Beyond Petroleum) sponsorship of Tate Galleries in London. Their life protests took place at one of London 's Tate Galleries, either Tate Britain or Tate Modern (2010-2016), and were recorded, edited and posted online on the group 's website. The article conceptualises the protests as interaction rituals (Collins, 2001); collective gatherings characterised by their group assembly, a shared focus of attention including an object/symbol and the creation of barriers to outsiders. If successful, they can lead to the production of group identity, and emotional energy, feelings of confidence, of enthusiasm, that translate into a desire for action, and collective, group symbols (Collins, 2001). The article draws upon and critiques Collins' perspective, arguing for the importance of embodiment and the online environment of protests in understanding their ability to produce emotional energy and collective identity.

T1  - Don't Hold Your Breath: Limited DNA Capture Using Non-Invasive Blow Sampling for Small Cetaceans
AN  - 2348899795
AB  - Non-invasive conservation strategies currently used to monitor small cetaceans in the United Kingdom mainly focus on photo identification of individuals as a method to generate estimates of population status. With increasing anthropogenic pressures in the form of renewable energy developments, fishing, and tourism, there is a need for molecular techniques to more accurately measure population structure and health status of freeranging cetaceans. Previous non-invasive DNA sampling has consisted of faecal, skin, or exhaled breath (blow) sampling. To date, blow sampling has been implemented primarily with an emphasis on microbial information, and field applications of this methodology have primarily targeted large mysticete cetaceans. In this study, we attempted to optimise an existing blow sampling protocol to enhance field sample collection and DNA recovery for both Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus delphis. Following previous recommendations, we streamlined the sampling approach to reduce the occurrence of avoidance behaviour and improve the precision for individual targeting. Overall, we collected 37 blow samples from T. truncatus (n = 7) and D. delphis (n = 30). Cetacean mtDNA was successfully extracted from one D. delphis sample, which is the first reported DNA detection of a small free-ranging cetacean from blow to our knowledge. Herein, we highlight the difficulty obtaining DNA from wild cetacean blow samples, despite improved collection success, and the uncertainty of determining the effects of storage on sample degradation prior to DNA extraction. We suggest future studies to improve DNA detectability through the use of robust preservatives such as an ethanol-sodium acetate solution. While promising, further optimisation is required to employ blow sampling as a conservation tool for estimates of respiratory microbial loads and individual identification for the purposes of genotype capture-recapture of small cetaceans.

T1  - Weather patterns and all-cause mortality in England, UK
AN  - 2343490308
AB  - Cold- and heat-related mortality poses significant public health concerns worldwide. Although there are numerous studies dealing with the association between extreme ambient temperature and mortality, only a small number adopt a synoptic climatological approach in order to understand the nature of weather systems that precipitate increases in cold- or heat-related mortality. In this paper, the Lamb Weather Type synoptic classification is used to examine the relationship between daily mortality and weather patterns across nine regions of England. Analysis results revealed that the population in England is more susceptible to cold weather. Furthermore, it was found that the Easterly weather types are the most hazardous for public health all-year-long; however, during the cold period, the results are more evident and spatially homogenous. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the most dangerous weather conditions are not always associated with extreme (high or low) temperatures, a finding which points to the complexity of weather-related health effects and highlights the importance of a synoptic climatological approach in elucidating the relationship between temperature and mortality.

T1  - Impacts of climate change and mitigation policies on malt barley supplies and associated virtual water flows in the UK
AN  - 2342396087
AB  - Barley is a major ingredient for the malting industry which is highly sensitive and vulnerable to malt barley supply. The United Kingdom (UK) has the second highest malting capacity in the EU and the third largest malting industry in the world, supplying malt to major global breweries. Premium whisky, which has both economic and cultural significance for the UK, also makes sustainable malt barley supply critical for the UK. There is paucity of information on the sustainability of future supplies of malt barley in the UK, as much as it is in the world. This study applied a food balance approach to assess the combined effects of climate change and mitigation policies on UK malt barley balances for the 2030s, 2040 s, and 2050 s. Future yields of spring barley were simulated under the low, medium and high emissions scenarios (or LES, MES, and HES, respectively) for the three time slices. Future areas of land for barley production were obtained via land use change simulation in response to climate mitigation policies and aspirations of the UK. Future yields and land areas were combined to obtain total barley production, which served as a basis of supply. Per capita malt barley consumption was combined with future population to obtain demand. The gaps between demand and supply were then assessed. The results show large deficits in malt barley supplies for all combinations of climate change, land use and population, with adverse implications for the malting industry. Total malt barley supplies under current land area for barley and using the 90th percentile yield, ranged from 1899 (LES, 2030s) to 2,437 thousand tonnes (HES, 2050s). The largest supply under climate mitigation land use scenarios ranged from 1,592 (LES, 2030s) to 2,120 thousand tonnes (HES, 2050s). Deficits in supply were observed for all climate mitigation land use scenarios and time slices, ranging from 128 to 585 thousand tonnes at 90th percentile yield. However, surpluses were observed from the 2040s if current land area for barley remains unchanged. Imports to balance the observed deficits would result in large inflows of blue water to the UK, with adverse implications for global freshwater supply and environmental sustainability. It is concluded that even though spring barley yields in the UK could increase under projected climate change, reductions in croplands (due mainly to climate mitigation policies and aspirations) could combine with population growth to undermine the sustainability of malt barley supplies, both nationally and internationally.

T1  - How much heat can we grow in our cities? Modelling UK urban biofuel production potential
AN  - 2326737766
AB  - Biofuel provides a globally significant opportunity to reduce fossil fuel dependence; however, its sustainability can only be meaningfully explored for individual cases. It depends on multiple considerations including: life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, air quality impacts, food versus fuel trade‐offs, biodiversity impacts of land use change and socio‐economic impacts of energy transitions. One solution that may address many of these issues is local production of biofuel on non‐agricultural land. Urban areas drive global change, for example, they are responsible for 70% of global energy use, but are largely ignored in their resource production potential; however, underused urban greenspaces could be utilized for biofuel production near the point of consumption. This could avoid food versus fuel land conflicts in agricultural land and long‐distance transport costs, provide ecosystem service benefits to urban dwellers and increase the sustainability and resilience of cities and towns. Here, we use a Geographic Information System to identify urban greenspaces suitable for biofuel production, using exclusion criteria, in 10 UK cities. We then model production potential of three different biofuels: Miscanthus grass, short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and SRC poplar, within the greenspaces identified and extrapolate up to a UK‐scale. We demonstrate that approximately 10% of urban greenspace (3% of built‐up land) is potentially suitable for biofuel production. We estimate the potential of this to meet energy demand through heat generation, electricity and combined heat and power (CHP) operations. Our findings show that, if fully utilized, urban biofuel production could meet nearly a fifth of demand for biomass in CHP systems in the United Kingdom's climate compatible energy scenarios by 2030, with potentially similar implications for other comparable countries and regions.

T1  - Population responses of bird populations to climate change on two continents vary with species’ ecological traits but not with direction of change in climate suitability
AN  - 2524298730; IND606788062
AB  - Climate change is a major global threat to biodiversity with widespread impacts on ecological communities. Evidence for beneficial impacts on populations is perceived to be stronger and more plentiful than that for negative impacts, but few studies have investigated this apparent disparity, or how ecological factors affect population responses to climatic change. We examined the strength of the relationship between species-specific regional population changes and climate suitability trends (CST), using 30-year datasets of population change for 525 breeding bird species in Europe and the USA. These data indicate a consistent positive relationship between population trend and CST across the two continents. Importantly, we found no evidence that this positive relationship differs between species expected to be negatively and positively impacted across the entire taxonomic group, suggesting that climate change is causing equally strong, quantifiable population increases and declines. Species’ responses to changing climatic suitability varied with ecological traits, however, particularly breeding habitat preference and body mass. Species associated with inland wetlands responded most strongly and consistently to recent climatic change. In Europe, smaller species also appeared to respond more strongly, whilst the relationship with body mass was less clear-cut for North American birds. Overall, our results identify the role of certain traits in modulating responses to climate change and emphasise the importance of long-term data on abundance for detecting large-scale species’ responses to environmental changes.

T1  - HOW NATURAL IS NATURAL? HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON WILDLIFE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN BRITAIN: COLIN MATTHEW MEMORIAL LECTURE
AN  - 2338503156
AB  - This article explores some of the ways in which historians can, and should, engage with current debates about the environment. What we often think of as ‘natural’ habitats in Britain – heaths, ancient woodland, meadows and the like – are largely anthropogenic in character, and much of our most familiar wildlife, from rabbits to poppies, are alien introductions. The environments we cherish are neither natural nor timeless, but are enmeshed in human histories: even the kinds of tree most commonly found in the countryside are the consequence of human choice. The ways in which the environment was shaped by past management systems – to produce fuel, as much as food – are briefly explored; and the rise of ‘rewilding’ as a fashionable approach to nature conservation is examined, including its practical and philosophical limitations and its potential impacts on the conservation of cultural landscapes.

T1  - Dry weather fears of Britain’s early ‘industrial’ canal network
AN  - 2252713685
AB  - The first large-scale water supply in Britain was not for potable domestic supplies, but for the canal network, the arteries of the industrial revolution. This paper examines how episodes of dry weather in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, reconstructed from early instrumental sources, impacted the developing canal network. Analysis reveals how a frequent lack of preparedness for even relatively minor drought events resulted in conflict between water users, with potentially serious socio-economic consequences. The economic pressure of compensating other users for loss or reduction of their water supply resulted in canal companies investing in technologies and management techniques that continue to be used today as drought mitigation strategies, such as the building of large-capacity reservoirs and groundwater abstraction. This period represents a key technological milestone in the development of the modern water supply systems, contextualising current challenges faced by the water industry in responding to drought events. Although the failure of the British canal system no longer has serious economic impacts, themes emerge from this research which are as relevant for water supplies today as they were in the eighteenth century, such as issues around water rights and the value of preparing for potential future extreme weather scenarios. A newly reconstructed composite precipitation series for Chatsworth House is presented (1760–present). Through comparing weather records within the archives of canal companies and their competitors for water supplies, historical insight can be gained into the possible far-reaching societal impacts of drought.

T1  - From waste to food: Optimising the breakdown of oil palm waste to provide substrate for insects farmed as animal feed
AN  - 2312798685
AB  - Waste biomass from the palm oil industry is currently burned as a means of disposal and solutions are required to reduce the environmental impact. Whilst some waste biomass can be recycled to provide green energy such as biogas, this investigation aimed to optimise experimental conditions for recycling palm waste into substrate for insects, farmed as a sustainable high-protein animal feed. NMR spectroscopy and LC-HRMS were used to analyse the composition of palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) under experimental conditions optimised to produce nutritious substrate rather than biogas. Statistical pattern recognition techniques were used to investigate differences in composition for various combinations of pre-processing and anaerobic digestion (AD) methods. Pre-processing methods included steaming, pressure cooking, composting, microwaving, and breaking down the EFB using ionic liquids. AD conditions which were modified in combination with pre-processing methods were ratios of EFB:digestate and pH. Results show that the selection of pre-processing method affects the breakdown of the palm waste and subsequently the substrate composition and biogas production. Although large-scale insect feeding trials will be required to determine nutritional content, we found that conditions can be optimised to recycle palm waste for the production of substrate for insect rearing. Pre-processing EFB using ionic liquid before AD at pH6 with a 2:1 digestate:EFB ratio were found to be the best combination of experimental conditions.

T1  - National-scale analysis of future river flow and soil moisture droughts: potential changes in drought characteristics
AN  - 2311915988
AB  - The potential impact of climate change on drought is of increasing concern, especially due to recent occurrences of major events across the globe. Here a national-scale grid–based hydrological model is used to investigate potential future changes in river flow and soil moisture droughts across Great Britain. The analysis uses ensembles of climate model data for four time periods (1930s, 1980s, 2030s and 2080s) under a “business-as-usual” (RCP8.5) emissions trajectory. The results show that the severity of droughts is projected to increase in the future. River flow droughts in southeastern regions are projected to increase in peak intensity and lengthen slightly, whereas peak intensities are projected to decrease for much of the rest of Britain. Droughts with the largest spatial extent across Britain are projected to increase in area for both river flow and soil moisture. More extreme droughts than previously experienced could have a significant impact on the aquatic environment as well as the availability of water for industry, agriculture and public water supply. Regional- to national-scale droughts could have implications for potential mitigation measures such as water transfer between regions. In turn, this could lead to social and economic impacts, especially as there are also likely to be future increases in demand.

T1  - Phylogeography of the second plague pandemic revealed through analysis of historical Yersinia pestis genomes
AN  - 2300157808
AB  - The second plague pandemic, caused by Yersinia pestis, devastated Europe and the nearby regions between the 14th and 18th centuries AD. Here we analyse human remains from ten European archaeological sites spanning this period and reconstruct 34 ancient Y. pestis genomes. Our data support an initial entry of the bacterium through eastern Europe, the absence of genetic diversity during the Black Death, and low within-outbreak diversity thereafter. Analysis of post-Black Death genomes shows the diversification of a Y. pestis lineage into multiple genetically distinct clades that may have given rise to more than one disease reservoir in, or close to, Europe. In addition, we show the loss of a genomic region that includes virulence-related genes in strains associated with late stages of the pandemic. The deletion was also identified in genomes connected with the first plague pandemic (541–750 AD), suggesting a comparable evolutionary trajectory of Y. pestis during both events.

T1  - Checking the sea: geographies of authority on the East Norfolk Coast (1790–1932)
AN  - 2293764009
AB  - This article examines coastal defence in East Norfolk between the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries. From 1802 until 1932 sea defence between Happisburgh and Winterton was the responsibility of the Commissioners of Sewers for the Eastern Hundreds of Norfolk, more commonly known as the Sea Breach Commission (SBC). This article explores the geographies of authority shaping sea defence, with the SBC a body whose relationship to the local and national state could be uneasy. The article outlines the SBC’s nineteenth-century roles and routines, and examines its relationship to outside expertise, including its early hiring of geologist William Smith. The article reviews challenges to the SBC’s authority following late nineteenth-century flood events, details its early twentieth-century routines, and examines disputes over development on the sandhills. The article details the SBC’s dealings with an emerging national ‘nature state’, around issues such as coastal erosion and land drainage, matters which led to the SBC’s demise following the 1930 Land Drainage Act. The article concludes by considering the SBC’s contemporary resonance in a time of challenges to the role of the nature state, and anxieties over coastal defence.

T1  - Mitigation potential and environmental impact of centralized versus distributed BECCS with domestic biomass production in Great Britain
AN  - 2289758725
AB  - New contingency policy plans are expected to be published by the United Kingdom government to set out urgent actions, such as carbon capture and storage, greenhouse gas removal and the use of sustainable bioenergy to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets of the 4th and 5th Carbon Budgets. In this study, we identify two plausible bioenergy production pathways for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) based on centralized and distributed energy systems to show what BECCS could look like if deployed by 2050 in Great Britain. The extent of agricultural land available to sustainably produce biomass feedstock in the centralized and distributed energy systems is about 0.39 and 0.5 Mha, providing approximately 5.7 and 7.3 MtDM/year of biomass respectively. If this land‐use change occurred, bioenergy crops would contribute to reduced agricultural soil GHG emission by 9 and 11 MtCO2eq/year in the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. In addition, bioenergy crops can contribute to reduce agricultural soil ammonia emissions and water pollution from soil nitrate leaching, and to increase soil organic carbon stocks. The technical mitigation potentials from BECCS lead to projected CO2 reductions of approximately 18 and 23 MtCO2/year from the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. This suggests that the domestic supply of sustainable biomass would not allow the emission reduction target of 50 MtCO2/year from BECCS to be met. To meet that target, it would be necessary to produce solid biomass from forest systems on 0.59 or 0.49 Mha, or alternatively to import 8 or 6.6 MtDM/year of biomass for the centralized and distributed energy system respectively. The spatially explicit results of this study can serve to identify the regional differences in the potential capture of CO2 from BECCS, providing the basis for the development of onshore CO2 transport infrastructures.

T1  - Historical flash floods in England: New regional chronologies and database
AN  - 2289334161
AB  - There is increasing interest in past occurrences of flooding from intense rainfall, commonly referred to as “flash flooding,” and the associated socioeconomic consequences. Historical information can help us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low frequency climate variability on changing flash flood frequencies. Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the temporal and spatial patterns of past events. Here, we provide an online flood chronology for the north and south‐west of England for flash floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage from ~1700 to ~2013 (http://ceg-fepsys.ncl.ac.uk/fc). The primary source of documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events in ungauged catchments.

T1  - What buildings policy might look like if we took climate change seriously
AN  - 2557908999
AB  - In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C. It called for “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” to reduce the risks of increasing climate change. Energy use in buildings is one of the key contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and EU. Detailed policies to support high standards in new build and acceleration of ambitious retrofit are a necessary part of any serious response to climate change.
This paper begins with a description of key UK policies on energy use in the buildings, and future UK government plans as expressed in the Clean Growth Strategy. It analyses the direction of travel, and looks at the rate of change compared with what will be required to rapidly reduce carbon emissions from the sector. Current buildings policies are insufficient to meet the challenge of climate change. Both positive and negative examples of changes in policy are presented.
A new conceptualization of the contribution of energy demand to delivering net zero goals, developed by CREDS, is introduced. In addition, key characteristics of the buildings sector and its energy use are put forward. Bringing together the role of energy demand, these characteristics of buildings, and the broader literature on buildings and energy policy, we have set out an exploratory set of guidelines for developing policy to reduce carbon emissions from buildings further, faster and more flexibly. These are classified into the guiding principle, approaches to policy creation, expanding the boundaries of policies and focus on quality. These should form the basis for further discussion.
If policy were designed as if we took climate change seriously, according to the guidelines developed, what would this mean for buildings? Fundamentally it would require a momentous change in the culture of construction, so that what is valued moves beyond design, aesthetics and functionality, to include low carbon and highly efficient performance. New targets and approaches to delivering them are required – and this paper contributes to thinking about both.

T1  - Understanding the decarbonisation of housing: Wales as a case study
AN  - 2557908508
AB  - International targets requiring UK nations to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050 were made obsolete in 2019. The Climate Change Act now commits UK government to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels by 2050. This includes more stringent emissions targets for the devolved administrations. Welsh Government is responsible for the delivery of decarbonisation in Wales. The Welsh housing stock, among the oldest and least efficient in Europe, produces 21% of national carbon emissions. The CCC report recommends that Wales target no less than a 95% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. This research explores how policy could deliver this scale of emissions reduction, by predicting the impact of established and emerging ‘best practice’ retrofit solutions on the existing housing stock. Fourteen recurring dwelling ‘types’ are identified within the Welsh housing stock (based on physical metrics, condition and tenure) using large data sets. Appropriate retrofit ‘narratives’ are established and then simulated for each of the fourteen dwelling types. Their impact is measured in terms of capital cost, primary energy use, fuel bills, and carbon emissions. By exploring the impact of a range of approaches to retrofit, and by considering different scenarios for clean energy supply, this research has informed the ongoing development of a route map for delivering decarbonisation targets in Wales.

TT  - A Importância Política da Desconstrução-Os Limites de Derrida?: Um Fórum sobre os Espectros de Marx de Jacques Derrida depois de 25 anos, Parte I
AN  - 2421990822
AB  - Jacques Derrida delivered the basis of The Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning, & the New International as a plenary address at the conference 'Whither Marxism?' hosted by the University of California, Riverside, in 1993. The longer book version was published in French the same year and appeared in English and Portuguese the following year. In the decade after the publication of Specters, Derrida's analyses provoked a large critical literature and invited both consternation and celebration by figures such as Antonio Negri, Wendy Brown and Frederic Jameson. This forum seeks to stimulate new reflections on Derrida, deconstruction and Specters of Marx by considering how the futures past announced by the book have fared after an eventful quarter century. Maja Zehfuss, Antonio Vázquez-Arroyo and Dan Bulley and Bal Sokhi-Bulley offer sharp, occasionally exasperated, meditations on the political import of deconstruction and the limits of Derrida's diagnoses in Specters of Marx but also identify possible paths forward for a global politics taking inspiration in Derrida's work of the 1990s.Alternate abstract:Jacques Derrida entregou a base de os Espectros de Marx: O Estado da Dívida, a Obra do Luto e a Nova Internacional como discurso plenário na conferência 'Para onde o marxismo?,' na Universidade da Califórnia, em Riverside, em 1993. A versão mais longa do livro foi publicada em francês no mesmo ano e em inglês e português no ano seguinte. Uma década após a publicação dos Espectros, as análises de Derrida provocaram uma grande literatura crítica e convidaram tanto a consternação quanto a celebração de figuras como Antonio Negri, Wendy Brown e Frederic Jameson.

T1  - Stability and changes in the distribution of Pipiza hoverflies (Diptera, Syrphidae) in Europe under projected future climate conditions
AN  - 2284755509
AB  - Climate change is now considered a significant threat to terrestrial biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are among the modern tools currently used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on species. Pipiza Fallén, 1810 is a well known aphidophagous hoverfly genus (Diptera, Syrphidae) at the European level, for which sampling has been conducted across the region, and long-term databases and geo-referenced datasets have been established. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the potential current distributions of the European species of this genus and their response to future climate change scenarios, as well as evaluated stability in their ranges and potential changes in species-richness patterns. We applied three climate models (BCC_CSM1.1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-ES) to four representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) for two time frames (2050 and 2070). Our results show that the distribution of most Pipiza species may slightly differ under different climate models. Most Pipiza species were predicted not to be greatly affected by climate change, maintaining their current extent. Percentages of stable areas will remain high (above 50%) for the majority of studied species. According to the predicted turnover of species, northern Europe, could become the richest in terms of species diversity, thus replacing Central Europe as the current hot spot.

T1  - Effects of climate change and horticultural use on the spread of naturalized alien garden plants in Europe
AN  - 2282391954
AB  - Climate warming is supposed to enlarge the area climatically suitable to the naturalization of alien garden plants in temperate regions. However, the effects of a changing climate on the spread of naturalized ornamentals have not been evaluated by spatially and temporarily explicit range modelling at larger scales so far. Here, we assess how climate change and the frequency of cultivation interactively determine the spread of 15 ornamental plants over the 21st century in Europe. We coupled species distribution modelling with simulations of demography and dispersal to predict range dynamics of these species in annual steps across a 250 × 250 m raster of the study area. Models were run under four scenarios of climate warming and six levels of cultivation intensity. Cultivation frequency was implemented as size of the area used for planting a species. Although the area climatically suitable to the 15 species increases, on average, the area predicted to be occupied by them in 2090 shrinks under two of the three climate change scenarios. This contradiction obviously arises from dispersal limitations that were pronounced although we assumed that cultivation is spatially adapting to the changing climate. Cultivation frequency had a much stronger effect on species spread than climate change, and this effect was non‐linear. The area occupied increased sharply from low to moderate levels of cultivation intensity, but levelled off afterwards. Our simulations suggest that climate warming will not necessarily foster the spread of alien garden plants in Europe over the next decades. However, climatically suitable areas do increase and hence an invasion debt is likely accumulating. Restricting cultivation of species can be effective in preventing species spread, irrespective of how the climate develops. However, for being successful, they depend on high levels of compliance to keep propagule pressure at a low level.

T1  - Early Holocene wetland succession at Lake Flixton (UK) and its implications for Mesolithic settlement
AN  - 2264891966
AB  - This paper reports on new research into the timing and nature of post-glacial environmental change at Lake Flixton (North Yorkshire, UK). Previous investigations indicate a succession of wetland environments during the early Holocene, ultimately infilling the basin by ca 7,000 cal bp. The expansion of wetland environments, along with early Holocene woodland development, has been linked to changes in the human occupation of this landscape during the Mesolithic (ca 11,300–6,000 cal bp). However, our understanding of the timing and nature of environmental change within the palaeolake is poor, making it difficult to correlate to known patterns of Mesolithic activity. This paper provides a new record for both the chronology and character of environmental change within Lake Flixton, and discusses the implications for the Mesolithic occupation of the surrounding landscape.

T1  - Do Town Planners in England feel a professional responsibility for a climate-resilient built environment?
AN  - 2557850908
AB  - With global warming already underway and the sense of urgency around climate breakdown growing, delivery of a resilient built environment is critical. Town planners are crucial intermediaries in this work but there is little recent work in the UK exploring their role in climate change resilience. In addressing the gap, the objective of the study was to examine resilience and professional identity of town planners. Interviews were conducted with 19 planners working in England who had at least seven years’ experience. Thematic analysis of the data found a strong professional and public service identity but little awareness of resilience. Many participants were unfamiliar with the concept, with the exception of specific actions such as planning for flood protection, and almost none were aware of resilience thinking incorporating conceptualisation of places as complex, interconnected, dynamic systems. We conclude that the built environment in England is not being prepared for imminent and future climate risks, and that the gaps on climate-resilience pose a threat to the profession’s jurisdiction.

T1  - Natural gas: A transition fuel for sustainable energy system transformation?
AN  - 2269372044
AB  - Current discourse on the transition to a decarbonized energy system future is dominated by renewable energy solutions. Initial conditions for this transition may vary across different regions and countries. There are, however, also opportunities for innovative solutions that utilize other low‐carbon energy sources and technology mix. Sustainable development is a contested concept and varies with priorities attached to social, economic, and environmental goals. Therefore, the one‐size‐fits‐all type of solution paradigm needs to be broadened, to accelerate action in the short to medium term. Our argument is that natural gas can be an important complementary transition fuel to support renewable energy in the short‐ and medium‐term transition phases. This means that the goal of zero fossil fuel as a short‐ and medium‐term solution needs to be reconsidered. This takes us to the next argument that innovation and upgraded technology in the low‐carbon fossil fuel sector will provide an important impetus for low‐carbon transition, which we see as a phase lasting until the middle of the century. However, the transition toward a sustainable energy future of gas‐fueled solutions has challenges from the social, technical, economic, geographical, and political points of view. Suitable local solutions should, however, also be assessed. These should take into consideration infrastructure, local demands, resources, and economic aspects as well as national energy policies. An analysis based on the experiences of four countries, both developed and developing, is presented in this study. The countries selected for this study can be placed in two categories: those with an abundance of natural gas reserves (Iran and Norway) and those that are import‐dependent (India and UK). The cross‐country analysis will help us to understand the realistic challenges and opportunities of natural gas as a transition fuel.

T1  - Isolating the climate change impacts on air-pollution-related-pathologies over central and southern Europe – a modelling approach on cases and costs
AN  - 2262016913
AB  - Air pollution has important implications for human health and associated external costs to society and is closely related to climate change. This contribution tries to assess the impacts of present (1996–2015) and future (2071–2100 under RCP8.5) air pollution on several cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies and estimate the difference in the costs associated with these health impacts on the European population. For this, air quality data from the regional chemistry–climate modelling system of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) are used, together with some epidemiological information from the European Commission. The methodology considered relies on the Economic Valuation of Air Pollution (EVA) exposure–response functions and economic valuations . Several hypotheses have been established, in order to strictly isolate the effects of climate change on air pollution and health: constant present-day emission levels and population density in the whole of Europe. In general, the number of cases for the pathologies considered will increase in the future (chronic bronchitis, heart failure, lung cancer, premature deaths), increasing the overall cost associated from EUR 173 billion per year to over EUR 204 billion per year at the end of the present century. Premature deaths are the most important problem in the target area in terms of costs (EUR 158 billion per year, increasing by 17 % in the future RCP8.5 2071–2100 projection) and cases (418 700 cases per year, increasing by 94 900 cases per year in the future). The most affected areas are European megacities, the Ruhr Valley and several cities in eastern Europe (e.g. Chişinău, Bucharest). For the RCP8.5 scenario, cases and costs will increase over southern and eastern Europe, while central and northern Europe could benefit from climate change variations (decreasing both cases and costs for the studied pathologies).

T1  - Epistemic Injustice as a Basis for Failure? Health Research Regulation, Technological Risk and the Foundations of Harm and Its Prevention
AN  - 2366300747
AB  - © Cambridge University Press 20202020Cambridge University PressI use the examples of medical devices, clinical trials and health data, to look at the framing of harm through the language of technological risk and failure. Across the examples, there is little or no suggestion of failure by those formally responsible. Failure is seen as arising when harm becomes refracted through calculative techniques and judgments, and reaches a point where the expectations of safety built into technological framings of regulation are thwarted. Technological framings may marginalise the contribution patients, research participants and others can make to regulation, which may in turn underlie harm and lead to the construction of failure. This marginalisation may amount to epistemic injustice. Epistemic injustice and its link to failure, which has normative weight over and above harm, can present a risk to organisational standing and reputation. This risk can be used to improve the knowledge base to include stakeholder knowledges of harm, and to widen responsibilities and accountabilities. This promises to allow regulation to better anticipate and prevent harm and failure, and improve the efficacy and legitimacy of the health research enterprise.

T1  - A Near-Field Gaussian Plume Inversion Flux Quantification Method, Applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sampling
AN  - 2306629910
AB  - The accurate quantification of methane emissions from point sources is required to better quantify emissions for sector-specific reporting and inventory validation. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serves as a platform to sample plumes near to source. This paper describes a near-field Gaussian plume inversion (NGI) flux technique, adapted for downwind sampling of turbulent plumes, by fitting a plume model to measured flux density in three spatial dimensions. The method was refined and tested using sample data acquired from eight UAV flights, which measured a controlled release of methane gas. Sampling was conducted to a maximum height of 31 m (i.e. above the maximum height of the emission plumes). The method applies a flux inversion to plumes sampled near point sources. To test the method, a series of random walk sampling simulations were used to derive an NGI upper uncertainty bound by quantifying systematic flux bias due to a limited spatial sampling extent typical for short-duration small UAV flights (less than 30 min). The development of the NGI method enables its future use to quantify methane emissions for point sources, facilitating future assessments of emissions from specific source-types and source areas. This allows for atmospheric measurement-based fluxes to be derived using downwind UAV sampling for relatively rapid flux analysis, without the need for access to difficult-to-reach areas.

T1  - ‘Fractures’ in food practices: exploring transitions towards sustainable food
AN  - 2271879454; IND606437468
AB  - Emissions arising from the production and consumption of food are acknowledged as a major contributor to climate change. From a consumer’s perspective, however, the sustainability of food may have many meanings: it may result from eating less meat, becoming vegetarian, or choosing to buy local or organic food. To explore what food sustainability means to consumers, and what factors lead to changes in food practice, we adopt a sociotechnical approach to compare the food consumption practices in North West England with two differing consumer groups. The first, supermarket shoppers ‘embedded’ in the mainstream food regime; and the second, who self-identify as sustainable food practitioners, and who perform a range of sustainable food consumption practices. We examine how our two groups experience changes in food practices and identify ‘fractures’ stemming from lifecourse and public events that emerge as points where change might occur. We suggest that ‘sharing spaces’ would be one possibility for prompting and nurturing fractures that can lead to greater sustainability in food practices.

T1  - The civil service’s gender diversity agenda under the coalition: where have the critical feminist actors gone?
AN  - 2230471645
AB  - This article examines the patterns of gender representation in the UK Civil Service to interrogate the claim that there was a regressive change in the proportion of women in the most senior grades of Whitehall under the UK Coalition Government (2010–2015). It does so by analysing both quantitative data covering civil service employment patterns during the Coalition years, complemented by new, primary qualitative data drawn from interviews conducted by the authors. The article presents an original explanation of these shifting patterns, emphasising the crucial role of ‘critical feminist actors’ in driving forward gender equality and diversity agendas in Whitehall. It concludes by highlighting dilemmas and risks involved in this agency-based approach to equality and diversity, which relies on the personal drive and commitment of key, senior actors; and at the same time is subject to the vicissitudes of change in personnel and political environment.

T1  - Assessing the Gap between Technology and the Environmental Sustainability of European Cities
AN  - 2181780163
AB  - The growth of cities’ population increased the interest in the opportunities and challenges that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have on carbon footprint reduction, which fosters their environmental sustainability. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), six ICT-related variables from European Union (EU) cities were combined into a single two-dimensional ICT index. Then, through cluster analysis, cities were clustered into four groups based on the ICT index and Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Using ICT as an indicator of smartness and CO2 emissions as an indicator of sustainability, we show that it is possible for a city to be smart but not sustainable and vice versa. Results also indicate that there is a gap between cities in northern Europe, which are the top performers in both categories, and cities in south-eastern Europe, which do not perform as well. The need for a common strategy for achieving integrated smart, sustainable and inclusive growth at a European level is demonstrated.

T1  - ‘Fractures’ in food practices: exploring transitions towards sustainable food
AN  - 2170792348
AB  - Emissions arising from the production and consumption of food are acknowledged as a major contributor to climate change. From a consumer’s perspective, however, the sustainability of food may have many meanings: it may result from eating less meat, becoming vegetarian, or choosing to buy local or organic food. To explore what food sustainability means to consumers, and what factors lead to changes in food practice, we adopt a sociotechnical approach to compare the food consumption practices in North West England with two differing consumer groups. The first, supermarket shoppers ‘embedded’ in the mainstream food regime; and the second, who self-identify as sustainable food practitioners, and who perform a range of sustainable food consumption practices. We examine how our two groups experience changes in food practices and identify ‘fractures’ stemming from lifecourse and public events that emerge as points where change might occur. We suggest that ‘sharing spaces’ would be one possibility for prompting and nurturing fractures that can lead to greater sustainability in food practices.

T1  - The challenge of incorporating animal welfare in a social life cycle assessment model of European chicken production
AN  - 2139822402
AB  - PurposeThere is increasing public concern over standards of farm animal welfare, yet the majority of sustainability studies of livestock have thus far focused only on environmental performance and profitability. Where social analysis has been carried out, there has yet to be a consistent methodology developed that incorporates animal welfare into social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). A framework was developed to assess animal welfare, using conventional broiler chicken meat production in Europe as a case in point.MethodsData were collected on stocking density, mortality, and carcass condemnation rate from conventional chicken meat production systems in Europe. The quantitative risk of each welfare indicator was characterised in accordance with the Social Hotspots Database methodology based on best to worst farm performances, i.e. quartiles of the data collected for each indicator. The overall animal welfare impact was assessed using a weighted sum methodology, which accounted for the level of risk animals were exposed to for each indicator and the animal lifespan. From this, a Social Hotspot Index (SHI) could be calculated for the animal welfare impact associated with the functional unit, which was 1 kg of chicken meat production. The animal welfare impact of four European countries was then compared.Results and discussionThe countries assessed displayed a range of values for overall animal welfare impact; the country with the best animal welfare had a SHI for animal welfare impact of 0.14, whilst the worst had a SHI for animal welfare impact of 0.72. Farms that kept more birds per building had an increased overall animal welfare impact. Animal welfare, determined by negative welfare indicators, was worse in more recently established farm buildings due to increased flock size.ConclusionsA methodology that incorporates animal welfare indicators into S-LCA was developed that is both scalable and related to welfare assessment frameworks. Although only some specific negative welfare indicators were considered here, the methodology could easily accommodate additional negative indicators and even positive welfare indicators as advancements are made in the understanding of animal welfare. Hence, this study provides a springboard for further development of S-LCA, animal welfare assessment and, ultimately, improved animal welfare in livestock systems.

T1  - Using the first European Breeding Bird Atlas for science and perspectives for the new Atlas
AN  - 2289183942
AB  - Capsule: The first European Bird Census Council (EBCC) Atlas of European Breeding Birds has been widely used in scientific publications.Aims: To quantify how scientific publications have used data from the first European Bird Census Council (EBCC) Atlas of European Breeding Birds, what the topics of these studies have been, and to identify key aspects in which a second European Breeding Bird Atlas will provide new opportunities for basic and applied science.Methods: We searched Google Scholar to find papers published in scientific journals that cited the first atlas. We analysed the contents of a random selection of 100 papers citing this atlas and described the way these papers used information from it.Results: The first atlas has been cited in 3150 scientific publications, and can be regarded as a fundamental reference for studies about birds in Europe. It was extensively used as a key reference for the studied bird species. A substantial number of papers re-analysed atlas data to derive new information on species distribution, ecological traits and population sizes. Distribution and ecology were the most frequent topics of studies referring to the atlas, but this source of information was used in a diverse range of studies. In this context, climate change, impact of agriculture and habitat loss were, by order, the most frequently studied environmental pressures. Constraints in the atlas, such as the poor coverage in the east of Europe, the lack of information on distribution change and the coarse resolution were identified as issues limiting the use of the atlas for some purposes.Conclusions: This study demonstrates the scientific value of European-wide breeding bird atlases. A second atlas, with its almost complete coverage across Europe, the incorporation of changes in distribution between the two atlases and the inclusion of modelled maps at a resolution of 10 × 10 km will certainly become a key data source and reference for researchers in the near future.

T1  - Expression levels of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase modulate plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana
AN  - 2229633844
AB  - This research was undertaken to investigate the global role of the plant inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (IPCS), a non-mammalian enzyme previously shown to be associated with the pathogen response. RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that over-expression of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase isoforms AtIPCS1, 2 or 3 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in plant response to pathogens. In addition, genes associated with the abiotic stress response to salinity, cold and drought were found to be similarly down-regulated. Detailed analyses of transgenic lines over-expressing AtIPCS1-3 at various levels revealed that the degree of down-regulation is specifically correlated with the level of IPCS expression. Singular enrichment analysis of these down-regulated genes showed that AtIPCS1-3 expression affects biological signaling pathways involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. The up-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and lipid localization was also observed in the over-expressing lines.

T1  - Towards a fire history of European cities (late Middle Ages to late nineteenth century)
AN  - 2193130509
AB  - Fires are often seen as a constant in early modern European towns, changing only in the modern era when inflammable building materials replaced wood. This article argues that the incidence, nature and risk of fire shifted repeatedly over time. Fire danger was determined not only by building materials but also by forms of construction, by the everyday uses people made of flame and by wider factors such as climatic variation and shifts in world trade and consumer demand. It was influenced by urban social and political change, including the way governments and populations responded to the risk. Responses to new fire dangers in turn helped change the way urban government functioned.

T1  - An assessment of the potential for natural flood management to offset climate change impacts
AN  - 2549051270
AB  - Natural Flood Management (NFM) aims to work with natural processes to reduce flood risk, and can potentially contribute to integrated flood risk management (alongside engineering solutions) by providing landscape-based resilience to climate change impacts. Here, two approaches are used to assess the extent to which NFM could offset the impacts of climate change on floods in Great Britain. The first looks at specific catchments where there is quantitative evidence for the effect of NFM measures on peak flows. The second takes a broad-brush national view, assuming two potential levels of NFM reductions in peak flows. Both approaches use flood impacts derived from climate change projections for a range of future time-slices and emissions scenarios. The results show that NFM measures are much less likely to be able to offset the impacts of climate change for later time-slices and for higher emissions scenarios, but also that the chance of offsetting the impacts of climate change in any individual catchment will depend on its type (how sensitive it is to climatic changes) and its location (due to spatial variation in climatic changes). Confounding factors in the analysis include any time lag associated with the NFM reduction in peak flows, and different effects of NFM on peak flows of different return periods. It is also unclear whether there is any relationship between a catchment’s type and its practical potential for implementing NFM, or the level of peak flow reduction that NFM could achieve; any such relationship could be critical in determining the overall potential for NFM to offset climate change impacts in different catchments. Although the focus here is Great Britain, a similar approach could be applied internationally.

T1  - THE ANTHROPOCENTRISM OF THE COSMIC PERSPECTIVE ARGUMENT
AN  - 2296126575
AB  - New developments in cosmology make it unlikely that life on Earth is unique. The Cosmic Perspective Argument states that given these developments we should not be concerned with the Earth's environmental degradation. In this paper, we argue that although scaling our analysis upwards into the cosmos provides the Cosmic Perspective with its strength, when we apply the Cosmic Perspective downwards, the view appears to be terribly flawed. After examining the Cosmic Perspective at an individual level, the problems that arise intensify and seemingly not only break the argument at an individual level but also on a much larger scale as well. These problems show the need for a framework that takes into full account the complex and interconnected nature of the environment, thus one that only deep ecology may provide.

T1  - FAO REPORT ON BIODIVERSITY FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AN  - 2237497648
AB  - For the purpose of the country-reporting process, biodiversity for food and agriculture was defined as follows: "...the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels that sustain the ecosystem structures, functions and processes in and around production systems, and that provide food and non-food agricultural products."

Analysis of the country reports and the wider literature indicates that BFA is affected by a variety of drivers operating at a range of levels: major global trends such as changes in climate, international markets and demography give rise to more immediate drivers such as land-use change, pollution and overuse of external inputs, overharvesting and the proliferation of invasive species.

Advanced crops for bioenergy, bioremediation, bio-based products and novel high value products, tackling fossil fuel dependence, climate change, land degradation, health challenges, and plastic and other forms of pollution, with renewable, plant-derived alternatives.

More environmentally sustainable and resilient agriculture with new plant varieties and practices that use water and other input resources more efficiently; reduce greenhouse gas emissions and harm to biodiversity, soils and waterways; and generate more consistent yields in varying climatic conditions.

T1  - Allometric Relations of Sycamore Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) and its Red Leaf Cultivar (A. pseudoplatanus "Atropurpureum") in Street and Park Habitats of Novi Sad (Serbia, Europe)
AN  - 2198417238
AB  - Adaptability and allometric relations of Acer pseudoplatanus and A. pseudoplatanus "Atropurpureum" at different urban sites are investigated in this work via the diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height, and crown width meas- urements, which served as ordinary least-squares regression model inputs. Differences between A. pseudoplatanus and A. pseudoplatanus "Atropurpureum," as well as intraurban variations of trees growing at different urban site categories (park and street) and location in the same urban site category with different urban morphology char- acteristics, were noted. The strongest allometric relations were noted for crown width/tree height and tree height/ dbh. Higher uniformity and better linear model fit were obtained for A. pseudoplatanus "Atropurpureum." Based on allometric relations with dbh as the predictor variable, trees growing in parks were shorter and had a wider crown than street trees, whereas the same tree proportions were observed in A. pseudoplatanus.

T1  - Bluetongue risk under future climates
AN  - 2172176667
AB  - There is concern that climate change will lead to expansion of vector-borne diseases as, of all disease types, they are the most sensitive to climate drivers1. Such expansion may threaten human health, and food security via effects on animal and crop health. Here we quantify the potential impact of climate change on a vector-borne disease of livestock, bluetongue, which has emerged in northern Europe in response to climate change2–4, affecting tens of thousands of farms at huge financial cost and causing the deaths of millions of animals5. We derive future disease risk trends for northern Europe, and use a detailed spatial transmission model6 to simulate outbreaks in England and Wales under future climatic conditions, using an ensemble of five downscaled general circulation models7. By 2100, bluetongue risk extends further north, the transmission season lengthens by up to three months and outbreaks are larger on average. A 1 in 20-year outbreak at present-day temperatures becomes typical by the 2070s under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario. However, animal movement restrictions are sufficient to prevent truly devastating outbreaks. Disease transmission uncertainty dominates over climate uncertainty, even at the longest prediction timescales. Our results suggest that efficient detection and control measures to limit the spread of vector-borne diseases will be increasingly vital in future, warmer climates.Bluetongue risk to livestock across northern Europe is projected to extend further north, with a longer transmission season and larger outbreaks on average. As a result, disease detection and control measures will be increasingly important.

T1  - Digging up Colonial Roots The Less-Known Origins of the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership
AN  - 2804786121
AB  - The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership (MSBP) at Wakehurst place in West Sussex, England is the largest repository of wild plant seeds in the world. According to their self-published institutional history, the MSBP was created to take on the mantle of global biodiversity conservation at a moment of ecological crisis. I study the bio-politics of the recasting of Kew’s role as arbiter of colonial botanical knowledge to keeper of botanical futures through seed banking. While the MSBP is a part of Kew’s vision to stay at the cutting edge of conservation and environmental governance, its relationship to colonial botany and political economy must also be interrogated in the light of its legacy. I revivify the origin story of the MSBP to show how Kew Gardens’ long tradition of plant extraction, accumulation, and exchange, as well as nationalist zeal motivated by the potential loss of ‘native species,’ were integral to the ‘rebranding’ of Kew as the MSBP.

T1  - Ravenstein Revisited: The Analysis of Migration, Then and Now
AN  - 2728501005
AB  - In 1876, 1885 and 1889, Ernst Ravenstein, an Anglo-German geographer, published papers on internal and international migration in Britain, Europe and North America. He generalized his findings as “laws of migration”, which have informed subsequent migration research. This paper aims to compare Ravenstein’s approach to investigating migration with how researchers have studied the phenomenon more recently. Ravenstein used lifetime migrant tables for counties from the 1871 and 1881 censuses of the British Isles. Data on lifetime migrants are still routinely collected but, because of the indeterminate time interval, they are rarely used to study internal migration. Today, internal migration measures from alternative sources are used to measure internal migration: fixed interval migrant data from censuses and surveys, continuous records of migrations from registers, and “big data” from telecommunications and internet companies.
Ravenstein described and mapped county-level lifetime migration patterns, using the concepts of “absorption” and “dispersion”, using migration rates and net balances. Recently, researchers have used lifetime migrant stocks from consecutive censuses to estimate country to country flows for the world. In the last decade, an Australian-led team has built an international database of internal migration flow data and summary measures. Methods were developed to investigate the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), in order to design summary internal migration measures comparable across countries. Indicators of internal migration were produced for countries covering 80 percent of the world’s population.
Ravenstein observed that most migrants moved only short distances, anticipating the development of “gravity” models of migration. Recent studies calibrated the relationship between migration and distance, using gravity models. For mid-19th century Britain, Ravenstein found the dominant direction of internal migration to be towards the “centres of commerce and industry”. Urbanization is still the dominant flow direction in most countries, though, late in the process, suburbanization, counter-urbanization and re-urbanization can occur. Ravenstein focussed on place-specific migration, whereas today researchers describe migration flows using area typologies, seeking spatial generality. Ravenstein said little about migrant attributes except that women migrated more than men. In recent decades, the behaviour of migrants by age, sex, education, ethnicity, social class and partnership status have been studied intensively, using microdata from censuses and surveys.
Knowledge about processes influencing internal and international migration has rarely been built into demographic projections. Scenarios that link migration with sub-national or national inequalities and with climate or environmental change are influencing the design of policies to reduce inequalities or slow global warming.

T1  - Associations between active travel and diet: cross-sectional evidence on healthy, low-carbon behaviours from UK Biobank
AN  - 2663862484
AB  - ObjectivesTo examine whether there are associations between active travel and markers of a healthy, low-carbon (HLC) diet (increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (FV), reduced consumption of red and processed meat (RPM)).DesignCross-sectional analysis of a cohort study.SettingsPopulation cohort of over 500 000 people recruited from 22 centres across the UK. Participants aged between 40 and 69 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010.Participants412 299 adults with complete data on travel mode use, consumption of FV and RPM, and sociodemographic covariates were included in the analysis.Exposure measuresMutually exclusive mode or mode combinations of travel (car, public transport, walking, cycling) for non-work and commuting journeys.Outcome measuresConsumption of FV measured as portions per day and RPM measured as frequency per week.ResultsEngaging in all types of active travel was positively associated with higher FV consumption and negatively associated with more frequent RPM consumption. Cycling exclusively or in combination with walking was most strongly associated with increased dietary consumption of FV and reduced consumption of RPM for both non-work and commuting journeys. Overall, the strongest associations were between non-work cycling and FV consumption (males: adjusted OR=2.18, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.30; females: adjusted OR=2.50, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.71) and non-work cycling and RPM consumption (males: adjusted OR=0.57, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.60; females: adjusted OR=0.54, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.59). Associations were generally similar for both commuting and non-work travel, and were robust to adjustment with sociodemographic and behavioural factors.ConclusionsThere are strong associations between engaging in active travel, particularly cycling, and HLC dietary consumption, suggesting that these HLC behaviours are related. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers and dynamics between these behaviours within individuals, and whether they share common underlying causes.

T1  - Revising Emission Responsibilities through Consumption-Based Accounting: A European and Post-Brexit Perspective
AN  - 2574327937
AB  - International trade shifts production of a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions embodied in traded goods from the importing country to the exporting country. The European Union (EU) plays a prominent role in the flow of international-related emissions as it accounts for the second largest share of global exports and imports of goods. Consumption-based accountings (CBA) emerged as alternative to the traditional emission inventories based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. According to the IPCC criteria, countries where products are consumed take no responsibility for the emissions produced by exporter countries, thus neglecting the emissions embodied in trade. By taking this aspect into account, CBA are considered of great importance in revealing emissions attributed to the final consumer. Using a CBA approach, this paper evaluates the impact of international trade in the EU in terms of CO2 emissions, looking both at the internal trade flows within the EU-28 and at the external trade flows between the EU and the rest of the world during the period 2012–2015. We find that the EU is a net importer of emissions as its emissions due to consumption exceed those due to production. In particular, in 2015 the ratio between import- and export-embodied emissions was more than 3:1 for the EU-28 that imported 1317 Mt CO2 from the rest of the world (mainly from China and Russia) while exporting only 424 Mt CO2. Concerning emissions flows among EU countries, Germany represents the largest importer, followed by the UK. To get a deeper understanding on possible environmental implications of Brexit on UK emission responsibilities, the paper also advances a few hypotheses on how trade flows could change based on the existing trade patterns of the UK. Data analysis shows that a 10% shift of UK imports from EU partners to its main non-EU trading partners (India, China, and US) would increase its emission responsibility by 5%. The increase in UK emission responsibility would more than double (+11%) in case of a 30% shift of UK imports. Similar results would apply if UK replaced its current EU partners with its main Commonwealth trading partners as a result of Brexit.

T1  - Governing Integration: Insights from Integrating Implementation of European Water Policies
AN  - 2550289482
AB  - Integrated water resource management (IWRM) is a well-established goal, but there is little evidence about processes of integration linked to water policies. To address this, in 2016–2018 we used a content analysis, a survey and interviews with key actors leading the creation of plans to implement Europe’s Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive. We explored whether and how implementation of these policies is being coordinated and reflect on implications for integrated water governance. We found a strong emphasis on achieving integration via coordination. Our interviews brought particular attention to the resources and capacities needed to improve collaboration across teams, including but not limited to information-sharing. Our study gives insight into practical approaches that may support coordination and hence integration of different policy goals for water management: however further theoretically-informed study to track these and other processes is required, as work to connect policy integration with IWRM is still in its infancy.

T1  - Four Dimensional Mapping of Vegetation Moisture Content Using Dual-Wavelength Terrestrial Laser Scanning
AN  - 2550288403
AB  - Recently, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has shown potential in measuring vegetation biochemical traits in three dimensions (3D) by using reflectance derived from backscattered intensity data. The 3D estimates can provide information about the vertical heterogeneity of canopy biochemical traits which affects canopy reflectance but cannot be measured from spaceborne and airborne optical remote sensing data. Leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT), a metric widely used in vegetation health monitoring, has been successfully linked to the normalized difference index (NDI) of near and shortwave infrared wavelengths at the leaf level. However, only two previous studies have linked EWT to NDI at the canopy level in field campaigns. In this study, an NDI consisting of 808 and 1550 nm wavelengths was used to generate 3D EWT estimates at the canopy level in a broadleaf mixed-species tree plot during and after a heatwave. The relative error in EWT estimates was 6% across four different species. Temporal changes in EWT were measured, and the accuracy varied between trees, a factor of the errors in EWT estimates on both dates. Vertical profiles of EWT were generated for six trees and showed vertical heterogeneity and variation between species. The change in EWT vertical profiles during and after the heatwave differed between trees, demonstrating that trees reacted in different ways to the drought condition.

T1  - Adding Value to Waste Minerals in a Circular Economy Framework: Ochre-Derived Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts in Fatty Acid Ketonisation
AN  - 2550211303
AB  - Transforming waste materials into added-value products is critical for a sustainable and circular economy. Here, Mg/Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials, with a Mg2+:Fe3+ ratio of 2, were successfully synthesized via the co-precipitation method from a dissolved acid mine drainage precipitate waste “ochre”, which is normally put to landfill. The prepared LDH materials were tested as a heterogeneous base catalyst to promote the production of the ketone, 12-tricosanone, from lauric acid, a component of plant oils, through a ketonic decarboxylation reaction, giving a circular economy route to catalysts for sustainable ketone production. The highest yield of the ketone observed was 80%.

T1  - Measuring the Strength of Root-Reinforced Soil on Steep Natural Slopes Using the Corkscrew Extraction Method
AN  - 2548450930
AB  - Roots can help to stabilise slopes against landslides and anchor trees against wind loading, but their mechanical contribution to the strength of soil is difficult to rapidly quantify under field conditions. A new field measurement method, quantifying the shear strength of rooted soil by measuring the resistance against extraction of soil cores using a large corkscrew device, was tested across three heterogeneous slopes (unforested, forested and clearfelled) in Scotland. The presence of roots significantly increased the measured shear strength in the surface layer of the Sitka spruce forested slope. Differences in strength between the three areas were however not significant. This could be attributed to the large variation in the soil component of the combined root–soil shear strength, which was strongly affected by variations in both soil density and gravel content. Measured strength on these natural slopes were much more variable compared to previously investigated sites. These results highlight the importance of investigating the variation in soil strength during root-reinforcement measurements, and furthermore demonstrate the need for a sufficiently large number of tests to address this variation. The corkscrew provides rapid estimation of root-reinforced soil shear strength on sites with difficult accessibility. Compared to the more conventional shear vane method, which yielded comparable soil strength results, the corkscrew proved more suitable in stony soil layers and has the additional benefit of simultaneously extracting small (rooted) soil samples that could be used for further root and soil analysis. It therefore proved a useful and effective field tool for use when a rapid estimation of root-reinforced soil shear strength is required.

T1  - A Simulation Study on the Potential of Moving Urban Freight by a Cross-City Railway Line
AN  - 2541327536
AB  - This paper analyses the scope for moving urban freight through rail by evaluating the utilisation levels of the Cross-City railway line in The United Kingdom (UK), running between Lichfield Trent Valley and Birmingham New Street. A simulation model of the railway system was built and implemented using SIMUL8 computer software. The results from the simulation model suggest that the railway line is being under-utilised. These low utilisation levels of the line presented a case to propose three scenarios that has the potential to carry urban freight by rail through Lichfield Trent Valley to Birmingham New Street Station. The total number of services operated on the line is varied between different scenarios. The proposed three scenarios could not only exploit the existing railway infrastructure by improving the utilisation levels of the currently operating railway line, but also proved to reduce an amount of green-house gases (GHGs) emissions that are caused by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) moving on the road. After simulating all the proposed scenarios in the SIMUL8 simulation software and analysing the results, scenario number 3 seemed to be the best replacement to the actual system as it presents a case to increase the number of train services running per day by in the line by 108 and causing a drastic improvement in the utilisation levels by an increase of 341.71% to that of the actual system. This proposed system has the potential to eliminate 5400 HGVs moving on the road per day that causes a reduction of CO2 gas by approximately 5.4%. All the scenarios presented in the study assures a sustainable method to move the urban freight by rail that has the potential to reduce congestion and emissions in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom (UK).

T1  - Influence of Automated Maneuvers on the Economic Feasibility of Tidal Energy Farms
AN  - 2541325071
AB  - The vertiginous increase in the global demand for energy, together with the imbalance between the period during when fossil resources were formed and the rhythm of their consumption, makes it necessary to promote renewable energies in order for energy consumption to coexist with sustainable development. One of the most important challenges as regards renewable energy generation is to be able to move to a new low carbon economy in which energy demands can be met while the levels of CO2 emitted are reduced. In this respect, most of the energy obtained from marine currents, the most predictable renewable energy source, is located at great depths. In order to take advantage of this energy, different types of technologies are currently being developed whose economic viability necessitates a reduction in costs. The development of automated systems that will allow the orientation and depth of tidal energy converters to change automatically in order to reduce maintenance maneuvers and take advantage of the energy resource in an optimal manner is, therefore, essential. This paper analyzes the economic feasibility of the automation of installation and maintenance maneuvers on tidal energy farms by means of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and costs. These aspects have been analyzed in the case of the Alderney Race (United Kingdom). The results obtained show that the use of marine current harnessing devices with automated maneuvers has a relatively important economic advantage over those devices designed with the technology that requires manual maneuvers for the installation and operation procedures, thus enabling the cost of energy to be reduced and increasing the profitability of the project.

T1  - Sustainable Diets in the UK—Developing a Systematic Framework to Assess the Environmental Impact, Cost and Nutritional Quality of Household Food Purchases
AN  - 2541322428
AB  - Sustainable diets should not only respect the environment but also be healthy and affordable. However, there has been little work to assess whether real diets can encompass all three aspects. The aim of this study was to develop a framework to quantify actual diet records for health, affordability and environmental sustainability and apply this to UK food purchase survey data. We applied a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to detailed food composition data where purchased food items were disaggregated into their components with traceable environmental impact data. This novel approach is an improvement to earlier studies in which sustainability assessments were based on a limited number of “food groups”, with a potentially high variation of actual food items within each group. Living Costs and Food Survey data for 2012, 2013 and 2014 were mapped into published figures for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE, taking into account processing, transport and cooking) and land use, a diet quality index (DQI) based on dietary guidelines and food cost, all standardised per household member. Households were classified as having a ‘more sustainable’ diet based on GHGE, cost and land use being less than the median and DQI being higher than the median. Only 16.6% of households could be described as more sustainable; this rose to 22% for those in the lowest income quintile. Increasing the DQI criteria to >80% resulted in only 100 households being selected, representing 0.8% of the sample. The framework enabled identification of more sustainable households, providing evidence of how we can move toward better diets in terms of the environment, health, and costs.

T1  - Comparison of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Potential of Energy Communities
AN  - 2346448202
AB  - In this research, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potentials of electric vehicles, heat pumps, photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries were determined in eight different countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Also, the difference between using prosuming electricity as a community (i.e., energy sharing) and prosuming it as an individual household was calculated. Results show that all investigated technologies have substantial GHG emission reduction potential. A strong moderating factor is the existing electricity generation mix of a country: the GHG emission reduction potential is highest in countries that currently have high hourly emission factors. GHG emission reduction potentials are highest in southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy) and lowest in countries with a high share of nuclear energy (Belgium, France). Hence, from a European GHG emission reduction perspective, it has most impact to install PV in countries that currently have a fossil-fueled electricity mix and/or have high solar irradiation. Lastly, we have seen that energy sharing leads to an increased GHG emission reduction potential in all countries, because it leads to higher PV capacities.

T1  - The Potential Role of Flexibility During Peak Hours on Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Life Cycle Assessment of Five Targeted National Electricity Grid Mixes
AN  - 2335343974
AB  - On the path towards the decarbonization of the electricity supply, flexibility and demand response have become key factors to enhance the integration of distributed energy resources, shifting the consumption from peak hours to off-peak hours, optimizing the grid usage and maximizing the share of renewables. Despite the technical viability of flexible services, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has not been proven. Traditionally, emissions are calculated on a yearly average timescale, not providing any information about peak hours’ environmental impact. Furthermore, peak-hours’ environmental impacts are not always greater than on the base load, depending on the resources used for those time periods. This paper formulates a general methodology to assess the potential environmental impact of peak-hourly generation profiles, through attributional life cycle assessment. This methodology was applied to five different countries under the INVADE H2020 Project. Evaluation results demonstrate that countries like Spain and Bulgaria could benefit from implementing demand response activities considering environmental aspects, enhancing potential greenhouse gas reductions by up to 21% in peak hours.

T1  - Supply Chain Partner Communication in a Managed Programme in the UK Water Industry: A Case Study with Social Network Analysis
AN  - 2329652675
AB  - Contingency theory [6], an important theoretical lens in management research, asserts that environmental features such as industry sector and operation philosophy bear importantly on what are suitable structures and practices.

[...]research on lesser-studied contexts and philosophies is needed to fill knowledge gaps for the benefit of both researchers and practitioners.

[...]the study addresses the following research question “How do key factors influence communication between partners in the top tiers of the supply chain of a UK water company’s asset management programme?” Data were collected longitudinally for months six and twelve of a five-year programme, and social network analysis was used to examine communication networks and how they evolve.

[...]our study responds to this gap in the literature by studying key factors influencing communication between employees of the water company and its partners in the top tier of the supply chain of this novel programme.

[...]we summarize our conclusions and suggest future research directions in Section 5.

T1  - Comparative Analysis of Small-Scale Organic Rankine Cycle Systems for Solar Energy Utilisation
AN  - 2316650718
AB  - [...]two heat exchangers serve as the evaporator and condenser for conventional ORC systems.

[...]heat transfer enhancement is conducive to overall system evaluation, which is greatly relevant to heat input as the denominator for calculating thermal efficiency [41].

Due to the characteristic of solar energy, the fluctuation could be accepted by using battery technology.

[...]a solar ORC using TDP may be desirable for domestic application, which is expected to have a higher thermal efficiency when compared with that of the conventional type.

To the authors’ best knowledge, few research studies on the solar ORC with TDP are reported.

[...]this paper aims to evaluate the performance of a small-scale ORC with TDP when operating at a low solar irradiance level.

Because flow rate of solar collector fluid has little influence on pump work, thus the difference of power output between two solar ORCs could be negligible when the collector fluid flow rate infinitely increases.

T1  - Making a Case for Local Combined Head and Power and District Heating Infrastructures within the United Kingdom Policy Landscape
AN  - 2301947941
AB  - Planning energy infrastructure at the local level is the key to addressing some of the most difficult challenges in climate change and energy policy planning (i.e. fuel poverty) and to unlock the transformative potential of distributed energy technologies. The scientific field of urban energy and carbon modelling is becoming a fundamental instrument to estimate an energy and carbon baseline at a point in time and to quantify the impact that policy-driven technological interventions that could have on the overall carbon footprint of a city. This capability enables an evidence-based approach in which the economic case towards a low-carbon economy can be made. Transformative local distributed energy technologies such as CHP or district heating have a strong spatial component due to a need to identify synergies with adjacent properties or heating loads. Currently available domestic building energy models often do not take into account spatial information. Accessing geo-referenced data for energy modelling can also be particularly useful as validated outputs (i.e. heating and electricity loads, energy profiles) can be mapped using spatial modelling techniques that help to easily identify high and low energy consumption areas and potential synergies in local energy infrastructure planning. In Newcastle upon Tyne UK, the council is exploring the opportunities for the installation of renewable heat technologies on their own stock as a matter of urgency. Identification of potential sites and feasibility for technical and financial applicability within the UK policies will be addressed by this paper.

T1  - The Impact of Brexit on EU Trade Policy
AN  - 2300264530
AB  - There has been increased interest in trade policy following the UK’s EU membership referendum. However, relatively little scholarly analysis has been produced on how Brexit will affect EU trade policy. Instead, the received wisdom has been that Brexit will shift the EU’s trade policy position in a less liberal direction. This is based on a ‘static’ analysis where the UK variable is simply removed from the figurative ‘function’ determining EU trade policy. We argue that this neglects the potential role of more ‘dynamic’ effects. First, the negotiations to determine the nature of the EU–UK future economic partnership are likely to involve a lengthy process with a still uncertain, and possibly evolving, destination. The outcome and process of arriving there will influence how economic operators and policymakers adapt their preferences and behaviour, including through possible relocation and the formation of new alliances. This will shape EU trade policy in potentially counterintuitive ways. Second, the absence of clear material structures from which actors can ‘read’ their interests highlights the importance of considering the role of ideas and political framing. How the vote for and consequences of Brexit are interpreted will likely shape what is considered an appropriate policy response. Examining EU trade policy since the Brexit vote, the article finds that rather than push the EU in a more illiberal direction, the referendum result has been used to reinforce the European Commission’s external liberalisation agenda. The Commission’s discursive response to Brexit and Donald Trump has been to portray the EU as a champion of free trade in an era of global populism.

T1  - The genus Hebeloma in the Rocky Mountain Alpine Zone
AN  - 2282243151
AB  - Numerous taxa of Hebeloma have been reported in association with Salix, Dryas, and Betula in arctic-alpine habitats. However, species are notoriously difficult to delineate because morphological features overlap, and previously there was little reliable molecular data available. Recent progress in ITS-sequencing within the genus, coupled with an extensive database of parametrically described collections, now allows comparisons between species and their distributions. Here we report 16 species of Hebeloma from the Rocky Mountain alpine zone from some of the lowest latitudes (latitude 36°–45°N) and highest elevations (3000–4000 m) for arctic-alpine fungi in the northern hemisphere. Twelve of these species have been reported from arctic-alpine habitats in Europe and Greenland and are now molecularly confirmed from the Middle and Southern Rockies, greatly expanding their distribution. These are: Hebeloma alpinum, H. aurantioumbrinum, H. dunense, H. hiemale, H. marginatulum, H. mesophaeum, H. nigellum, H. oreophilum, H. subconcolor, H. spetsbergense, H. vaccinum, and H. velutipes. Hebeloma hygrophilum is known from subalpine habitats in Europe, but was never recorded in arctic-alpine ecology. Three species recorded from the Rockies, but as yet not reported from Europe, are H. alpinicola, H. avellaneum, and H. excedens. The last two have never previously been reported from an arctic-alpine habitat. For all three of these species, the holotypes have been studied morphologically and molecularly, and have been incorporated into the analysis.

T1  - Assessing the characteristics and drivers of compound flooding events around the UK coast
AN  - 2262010769
AB  - In low-lying coastal regions, flooding arises from oceanographic (storm surges plus tides and/or waves), fluvial (increased river discharge), and/or pluvial (direct surface run-off) sources. The adverse consequences of a flood can be disproportionately large when these different sources occur concurrently or in close succession, a phenomenon that is known as “compound flooding”. In this paper, we assess the potential for compound flooding arising from the joint occurrence of high storm surge and high river discharge around the coast of the UK. We hypothesise that there will be spatial variation in compound flood frequency, with some coastal regions experiencing a greater dependency between the two flooding sources than others. We map the dependence between high skew surges and high river discharge, considering 326 river stations linked to 33 tide gauge sites. We find that the joint occurrence of high skew surges and high river discharge occurs more frequently during the study period (15–50 years) at sites on the south-western and western coasts of the UK (between three and six joint events per decade) compared to sites along the eastern coast (between zero and one joint events per decade). Second, we investigate the meteorological conditions that drive compound and non-compound events across the UK. We show, for the first time, that spatial variability in the dependence and number of joint occurrences of high skew surges and high river discharge is driven by meteorological differences in storm characteristics. On the western coast of the UK, the storms that generate high skew surges and high river discharge are typically similar in characteristics and track across the UK on comparable pathways. In contrast, on the eastern coast, the storms that typically generate high skew surges are mostly distinct from the types of storms that tend to generate high river discharge. Third, we briefly examine how the phase and strength of dependence between high skew surge and high river discharge is influenced by the characteristics (i.e. flashiness, size, and elevation gradient) of the corresponding river catchments. We find that high skew surges tend to occur more frequently with high river discharge at catchments with a lower base flow index, smaller catchment area, and steeper elevation gradient. In catchments with a high base flow index, large catchment area, and shallow elevation gradient, the peak river flow tends to occur several days after the high skew surge. The previous lack of consideration of compound flooding means that flood risk has likely been underestimated around UK coasts, particularly along the south-western and western coasts. It is crucial that this be addressed in future assessments of flood risk and flood management approaches.

T1  - Geographical location affects size and materials used in the construction of European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nests
AN  - 2227334827
AB  - Background 
Nest construction is a key element of avian reproductive behaviour and the result is often a complex structure that is used for incubation of eggs, which represents an extended phenotype. It is known that nest construction is a plastic behaviour but the extent to which plasticity is observed in a single species with a wide geographical distribution is largely unknown. This study sought to better understand variation in nest size and composition across a very wide geographical area. The hypothesis suggested that location would affect size but not composition of nests of the European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca).
 Methods 
Nests and reproductive data were collected from seventeen study sites, spread over 6° of latitude and 3.3° of longitude on the island of Great Britain. Dimensions of nests were measured before they were deconstructed to determine the masses and types materials used in the outer nest and the cup lining.
 Results 
Geographical variation was observed in base thickness of nests but not many other dimensions. Nests varied in composition but were mainly made of leaf, moss, bark, grass, root and fern. Moss was used more to the north and east of the study area compared with more leaf mass towards the south and west. The species of leaf and bark used in the nests varied between geographical locations. Additionally, the use of leaves or bark from a particular tree species did not reflect the incidence of the tree species in the immediate territory.
 Conclusions 
This study showed that nest composition was affected by geographical location over a wide area. Variation between nests at each location was high and so it was concluded that differences in nest composition reflect individual selection of materials but evidence is such that it remains unclear whether this is deliberate to fulfil a specific role in the nest, or simply opportunistic with birds simply picking up materials with the appropriate characteristics as they find them outside their nestbox.

T1  - Sacrifice or Solipsism: Paradoxes of Freedom in Two Anarchist Social Centres
AN  - 2190922988
AB  - In this paper I analyse and problematise what I argue are the dominant modes of liberated subject formation performed through divergent modes of organising within two anarchist social centres in Bristol, UK. Drawing on practical examples, I show how practices oriented to equality, like consensus decision-making and more formalised and codified modes of conduct, perform and presuppose a conception of freedom as coextensive with the attainment of rational subjectivity. In order to participate, to consent and to practice the self-limitation required to safeguard the freedom of others, sovereignty over the self is required - reason must outweigh desire. Yet as the activist subject defers pleasure for the sake of others, the practice of freedom comes to feel more like moral duty. Participation is at once the marker of freedom yet enacted out of an obligation that is as oppressive to anarchists as it is patronising to the mythical community we/they try to attract. Arising in opposition to the felt oppression of these practices, I identify a set of more spontaneous, joyful and less codified (anti-)organisational forms. Against the duty-bound activism of the rational activist, this counter-current embraces a conception of personal freedom as the liberation of desire. While this approach creatively counters the 'martyrdom' of the activist to the collective cause, it risks a moral solipsism that is equally unacceptable to anarchists. Whether possessed of own desire or rational will, freedom, in both sets of practices, is seen as coextensive with sovereignty over the self. Freedom and equality are thus diametrically opposed.

T1  - Utilising Principles of Earth Jurisprudence to Prevent Environmental Harm: Applying a Case Study of Unconventional Hydraulic Fracturing for Shale Gas in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2169188547
AB  - Approaching behaviour that produces environmental harm through the medium of criminal sanctions (largely involving monetary penalties) has been criticised consistently as failing to prevent environmental crimes and harms, and failing to concurrently reduce environmental re-offending. Furthermore, important state–corporate political and economic relationships exist that ensure the continuation of environmental degradation. We suggest that a way to overcome this is to re-work the current legal system to one grounded in Earth jurisprudence. Although we realise that state–corporate relationships would likely prevent the implementation of Earth jurisprudential principles, we argue such principles are essential to up-end the prioritisation of economic imperatives over ecological values within capitalist societies. To demonstrate the strength and utility of the Earth jurisprudential approach, we use the case of fracking for shale gas in the United Kingdom to examine how Earth jurisprudential principles could prevent environmental harm from occurring.

T1  - The effect of temperature, farm density and foot-and-mouth disease restrictions on the 2007 UK bluetongue outbreak
AN  - 2167021024
AB  - In 2006, bluetongue (BT), a disease of ruminants, was introduced into northern Europe for the first time and more than two thousand farms across five countries were affected. In 2007, BT affected more than 35,000 farms in France and Germany alone. By contrast, the UK outbreak beginning in 2007 was relatively small, with only 135 farms in southeast England affected. We use a model to investigate the effects of three factors on the scale of BT outbreaks in the UK: (1) place of introduction; (2) temperature; and (3) animal movement restrictions. Our results suggest that the UK outbreak could have been much larger had the infection been introduced into the west of England either directly or as a result of the movement of infected animals from southeast England before the first case was detected. The fact that air temperatures in the UK in 2007 were marginally lower than average probably contributed to the UK outbreak being relatively small. Finally, our results indicate that BT movement restrictions are effective at controlling the spread of infection. However, foot-and-mouth disease restrictions in place before the detection and control of BT in 2007 almost certainly helped to limit BT spread prior to its detection.

T1  - Governing the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Related to Hydropower on Shared Rivers—The Role of Regional Organizations
AN  - 2284137823
AB  - An evolving literature on the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus argues that there is a need to better understand the conditions under which nexus coordination may occur. A case in point are hydropower investments on shared rivers which might impact the provision of energy, water and food security across borders. In international basins, governing the WEF nexus impacts of hydropower relies on voluntary negotiations between the respective countries involved. It has been argued that such negotiations may be facilitated by regional organizations, such as international river basin organizations (IRBOs), but this claim has hardly been investigated systematically. Drawing on regime theory in international relations and the literature on benefit sharing, this paper asks what role regional organizations may play in governing hydropower-related WEF nexus impacts. It compares three cases of hydropower planning on shared rivers. The Rusumo Falls and the Ruzizi III hydropower projects (HPPs) are joint investments in Africa’s Great Lakes region facilitated by an IRBO and a regional energy organization respectively. On the Mekong, Laos is constructing the Xayaburi dam despite reservations by the Mekong River Commission and downstream riparians. The paper finds IRBOs and regional energy organizations may play a role in facilitating cross-border nexus governance by supporting benefit-sharing arrangements and by fostering the application of environmental and social safeguards and international law principles. However, it also shows that the influence of regional organizations varies, and how successfully they support nexus governance also depends on whether the HPP is planned unilaterally or jointly; the availability and consensus on data on nexus impacts; and the presence or absence of donors and private sector capital and investors.

T1  - Healthy publics: enabling cultures and environments for health
AN  - 2792260347
AB  - Despite extraordinary advances in biomedicine and associated gains in human health and well-being, a growing number of health and well-being related challenges have remained or emerged in recent years. These challenges are often ‘more than biomedical’ in complexion, being social, cultural and environmental in terms of their key drivers and determinants, and underline the necessity of a concerted policy focus on generating healthy societies. Despite the apparent agreement on this diagnosis, the means to produce change are seldom clear, even when the turn to health and well-being requires sizable shifts in our understandings of public health and research practices. This paper sets out a platform from which research approaches, methods and translational pathways for enabling health and well-being can be built. The term ‘healthy publics’ allows us to shift the focus of public health away from ‘the public’ or individuals as targets for intervention, and away from the view that culture acts as a barrier to efficient biomedical intervention, towards a greater recognition of the public struggles that are involved in raising health issues, questioning what counts as healthy and unhealthy and assembling the evidence and experience to change practices and outcomes. Creating the conditions for health and well-being, we argue, requires an engaged research process in which public experiments in building and repairing social and material relations are staged and sustained even if, and especially when, the fates of those publics remain fragile and buffeted by competing and often more powerful public formations.

T1  - Native American Perspectives on Health and Traditional Ecological Knowledge
AN  - 2237696592
AB  - Background: 
Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is a conceptual framework that highlights Indigenous knowledge (IK) systems. Although scientific literature has noted the relevance of TEK for environmental research since the 1980s, little attention has been given to how Native American (NA) scholars engage with it to shape tribal-based research on health, nor how non-Native scholars can coordinate their approaches with TEK. This coordination is of particular importance for environmental health sciences (EHS) research exploring interdisciplinary approaches and the integration of environmental and human health.
 Objective: 
Our perspective on TEK arose from a series of Health and Culture Research Group (HCRG) workshops that identified gaps in existing EHS methodologies that are based on a reliance on Euro-American concepts for assessing environmental exposures in tribal communities. These prior methods neither take into account cultural behavior nor community responses to these. Our objective is to consider NA perspectives on TEK when analyzing relationships between health and the environment and to look at how these may be applied to address this gap.
 Discussion: 
The authors—the majority of whom are NA scholars—highlight two research areas that consider health from a TEK perspective: food systems and knowledge of medicinal plants. This research has yielded data, methods, and knowledge that have helped Indigenous communities better define and reduce health risks and protect local natural food resources, and this TEK approach may prove of value to EHS research.
 Conclusion: 
NA perspectives on TEK resulting from the HCRG workshops provide an opportunity for developing more accurate Indigenous health indicators (IHI) reflecting the conceptualizations of health maintained in these communities. This approach has the potential to bridge the scientific study of exposure with methods addressing a tribal perspective on the sociocultural determinants of health, identifying potential new areas of inquiry in EHS that afford nuanced evaluations of exposures and outcomes in tribal communities.

T1  - Mass Observation and the Emotional Energy Consumer
AN  - 2174566263
AB  - Understanding how people lived with energy in the past is becoming increasingly important as policy-makers are paying more attention to the social and cultural factors that condition energy consumption and fix energy demand. This is challenging historians to demonstrate the ways in which energy systems are more than just physical infrastructures set into the built environment but activated by users with complex emotional lives. This article goes some way toward developing this history, building up a profile of the emotional energy consumer. To do this it draws upon a collection of material from the Mass Observation Archive (MOA), University of Sussex, which provides unique access to the emotions British users brought to their energy systems. Drawing upon a series of Directives written in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the article considers how energy demand was shaped by the complex emotional cultures of Thatcherite Britain. The article proposes two different approaches to do this. The first approach considers how observers rooted emotions about energy in longer individual and social timeframes. This uncovers the importance of time in fostering emotions toward energy, from the lived experience of transitions, to the social memory of World War II and circulating rhetoric about the future. The second approach considers how emotions — such as sentimentality, nostalgia, love and fear — structured energy choices and led to particular configurations of energy use in the home. By demonstrating how emotion mediated between observers and their energy systems this article argues for the necessity of developing histories of energy focussed not only upon energy systems but that centre the complex subjectivities of users as well as their emotional cultures.
Comprendre la façon dont les gens ont vécu avec l'énergie par le passé devient de plus en plus important au moment où les décideurs s'intéressent davantage aux facteurs sociaux et culturels qui conditionnent la consommation d'énergie et façonnent la demande énergétique. Cette situation met au défi les historiens de montrer les façons dont les systèmes énergétiques sont beaucoup plus que de simples infrastructures physiques, mais sont activés par des consommateurs aux vies émotionnelles complexes. Le présent article se propose dans une certaine mesure d'établir un profil du consommateur d'énergie émotionnel. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie sur une collection de ressources provenant du Archives d'observation de masse (Mass Observation Project, ou MOA) de l'Université du Sussex, qui permet un accès unique aux sensibilités que les consommateurs britanniques ont développées vis-à-vis de leurs systèmes énergétiques. Faisant fond d'une série de directives élaborées à la fin des années 1980 et au début des années 1990, cet article examine   la façon dont la demande énergétique fut façonnée par les cultures émotionnelles complexes de la Grande-Bretagne thatchérienne. À cette fin, l'article propose deux approches différentes. La première examine la façon dont les observateurs ont ancré les émotions concernant l'énergie dans des échéanciers individuels et sociaux plus longs. Cette réalité révèle l'importance de l'élément du temps dans la stimulation des émotions envers l'énergie, l'expérience vécue des transitions, la mémoire sociale de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale et la rhétorique en cours au sujet de l'avenir. La seconde approche examine la façon dont les émotions — notamment la sentimentalité, la nostalgie, l'amour et la peur — ont structuré les choix énergétiques et mené à des configurations particulières de la consommation d'énergie dans les ménages. En démontrant la manière dont l'émotion a servi de médiateur entre les observateurs et leurs systèmes énergétiques, ce travail prône la nécessité d'élaborer des histoires d'énergie basées non seulement sur des systèmes énergétiques mais plutôt sur les subjectivités complexes des consommateurs ainsi que leurs cultures émotionnelles.

T1  - Time-since-invasion increases native mesoherbivore feeding rates on the invasive alga, Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt
AN  - 2158245538
AB  - Invasive algae can have substantial negative impacts in their invaded ranges. One widely cited mechanism that attempts to explain how invasive plants and algae are often able to spread quickly, and even become dominant in their invaded ranges, is the Enemy Release Hypothesis. This study assessed the feeding behaviours of two species of gastropod herbivore from populations exposed to the invasive alga Sargassum muticum for different lengths of time. Feeding trials, consisting of both choice and no-choice, showed that the herbivores from older stands (35–40 years established) of S. muticum were more likely to feed upon it than those taken from younger (10–19 years established) stands. These findings provide evidence in support of the ERH, by showing that herbivores consumed less S. muticum if they were not experienced with it. These findings are in accordance with the results of other feeding-trials with S. muticum, but in contrast to research that utilizes observations of herbivore abundance and diversity to assess top-down pressure. The former tend to validate the ERH, and the latter typically reject it. The potential causes of this disparity are discussed, as are the importance of palatability, herbivore species and time-since-invasion when considering research into the ERH. This study takes an important, yet neglected, approach to the study of invasive ecology.

T1  - Soil nitrous oxide flux following land‐use reversion from Miscanthus and SRC willow to perennial ryegrass
AN  - 2131031576
AB  - Decarbonization of the world's energy supply is essential to meet the targets of the 2016 Paris climate change agreement. One promising opportunity is the utilization of second generation, low input bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow. Research has previously been carried out on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of growing these feedstocks and land‐use changes involved in converting conventional cropland to their production; however, there is almost no body of work understanding the costs associated with their end of life transitions back to conventional crops. It is likely that it is during crop interventions and land‐use transitions that significant GHG fluxes might occur. Therefore, in this study, we investigated soil GHG fluxes over 82 weeks during transition from Miscanthus and SRC willow into perennial ryegrass in west Wales, UK. This study captured soil GHG fluxes at a weekly time step, alongside monthly changes in soil nitrogen and labile carbon and reports the results of regression modelling of suspected drivers. Methane fluxes were typically trivial; however, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were notably affected, reverted plots produced significantly more N2O than retained controls and Miscanthus produced significantly higher fluxes overall than willow plots. N2O costs of reversion appeared to be contained within the first year of reversion when the Miscanthus plots produced an average pregrass flux of 0.13 mg N2O m−2 hr−1 while for willow, this was 0.03 mg N2O m−2 hr−1. Total N2O emission from reversion increased the carbon cost over the lifetime of the Miscanthus from 6.50 to 9.91 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 while for the willow, this increase was from 9.61 to 10.42 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1. Despite these significant increases, the carbon cost of energy contained in these perennial crops remained far lower than the equivalent carbon cost of energy in coal.

T1  - Variation in Cold-Related Mortality in England Since the Introduction of the Cold Weather Plan: Which Areas Have the Greatest Unmet Needs?
AN  - 2582820984
AB  - The Cold Weather Plan (CWP) in England was introduced to prevent the adverse health effects of cold weather; however, its impact is currently unknown. This study characterizes cold-related mortality and fuel poverty at STP (Sustainability and Transformation Partnership) level, and assesses changes in cold risk since the introduction of the CWP. Time series regression was used to estimate mortality risk for up to 28 days following exposure. Area level fuel poverty was used to indicate mitigation against cold exposure and mapped alongside area level risk. We found STP variations in mortality risk, ranging from 1.74, 1.44–2.09 (relative risk (RR), 95% CI) in Somerset, to 1.19, 1.01–1.40 in Cambridge and Peterborough. Following the introduction of the CWP, national-level mortality risk declined significantly in those aged 0–64 (1.34, 1.23–1.45, to 1.09, 1.00–1.19), but increased significantly among those aged 75+ (1.36, 1.28–1.44, to 1.58, 1.47–1.70) and for respiratory conditions (1.78, 1.56–2.02, to 2.4, 2.10–2.79). We show how spatial variation in cold mortality risk has increased since the introduction of the CWP, which may reflect differences in implementation of the plan. Combining risk with fuel poverty information identifies 14 STPs with the greatest need to address the cold effect, and that would gain most from enhanced CWP activity or additional intervention measures.

T1  - Rethinking the Continuum between Public and Private Actors in Electricity Policy in the Context of the UK Energy Transition *
AN  - 2174212411
AB  - At the turn of the 1990s, a very large part of UK energy utilities was transferred from the public sector into private ownership. When analysing the era of privatisation, recent research on public policy has concluded that public authorities' ability to influence or shape national energy choices has been substantially weakened. Since the mid-2000s, however, tight cooperation between private investors and UK public regulators and policy-makers has emerged as a critical factor to meet the challenges posed by the energy transition. How have the British public authorities tried to get private actors on board and to involve them not only in the delivery and funding of energy services, as has been the case with public-private partnerships, but also in the decision-making process? This article identifies various schemes spearheaded by the UK government to breed or revive innovation in the privately-owned renewable and nuclear energy industries. This analysis explores the various strategies used to facilitate 'decompartmentalising' initiatives and ensure a smooth transition towards a neo-corporatist revival of the Triple Helix involving industry, academia, and government. It shows how these hybrid processes offer valuable insight for analysing and reconceptualising the boundary between the public and the private sectors. Based on this case study, this analysis ultimately demonstrates how the public/private dichotomy should be reassessed using the concepts of hybrid roles and responsibilities.

T1  - A regional frequency analysis of UK sub‐daily extreme precipitation and assessment of their seasonality
AN  - 2129403953
AB  - Floods related to extreme precipitation events, especially intense, short‐duration precipitation, may cause significant damage in urbanized areas, including transport infrastructure, electricity networks, and property. These events are expected to increase in frequency with climate change but their characteristics, at either hourly or multi‐hourly timescales, have been little studied due to short and poor quality data records. We examine annual maximum (AMAX) hourly and multi‐hourly (3, 6, 12, and 24 hr) precipitation accumulations in the United Kingdom using a quality‐controlled hourly precipitation data set for the period 1992–2014. We describe their seasonality and diurnal cycle and use a regional frequency analysis (RFA) approach with L‐moments to produce at‐site return level estimates, and then use existing extreme precipitation regions to provide regional‐scale return levels. The analysis shows a clear seasonality and the dominant occurrence of short‐duration AMAX in summer with similar seasonality for 1 and 3 hr accumulation periods in some regions, while longer‐duration AMAX (12 and 24 hr) behave similarly to each other in all regions but are distributed over a longer period including late autumn and winter. The diurnal cycle of 1 hr AMAX indicates that most extremes occur during the afternoon, with a peak typically between 1400 and 1700, especially in southern and eastern regions. However, we also demonstrate that existing regions for UK daily extremes are not able to adequately reflect differences at shorter durations and that new regions should be created. These results provide new insights to help in designing urban drainage systems and infrastructure, including the need for new scaling relationships between sub‐daily and design accumulation periods.

T1  - Projected changes in extreme precipitation over Scotland and Northern England using a high-resolution regional climate model
AN  - 2015710350
AB  - The UK Met Office has previously conducted convection-permitting climate simulations over the southern UK (Kendon et al. in Nat Clim Change 4:570–576, 2014). The southern UK simulations have been followed up by a new set of northern UK simulations using the same model configuration. Here we present the mean and extreme precipitation projections from these new simulations. Relative to the southern UK, the northern UK projections show a greater summertime increase of return levels and extreme precipitation intensity in both \[1.5\,\hbox {km}\] convection-permitting and \[12\,\hbox {km}\] convection-parameterised simulations, but this increase is against a backdrop of large decreases in summertime mean precipitation and precipitation frequency. Similar to the southern UK, projected change is model resolution dependent and the convection-permitting simulation projects a larger intensification. For winter, return level increases are somewhat lower than for the southern UK. Analysis of model biases highlight challenges in simulating the diurnal cycle over high terrain, sensitivity to domain size and driving-GCM biases, and quality issues of radar precipitation observations, which are relevant to the wider regional climate modelling community.

T1  - Implications of transforming climate change risks into security risks
TT  - Transforming climate change risks
AN  - 2120218102
AB  - PurposeA number of severe weather events have influenced a shift in UK policy concerning how climate-induced hazards are managed. Whist this shift has encouraged improvements in emergency management and preparedness, the risk of climate change is increasingly becoming securitised within policy discourses, and enmeshed with broader agendas traditionally associated with human-induced threats. Climate change is seen as a security risk because it can impede development of a nation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the evolution of the securitisation of climate change, and interrogates how such framings influence a range of conceptual and policy focused approaches towards both security and climate change.Design/methodology/approachDrawing upon the UK context, the paper uses a novel methodological approach combining critical discourse analysis and focus groups with security experts and policymakers.FindingsThe resulting policy landscape appears inexorably skewed towards short-term decision cycles that do little to mitigate longer-term threats to the nation’s assets. Whilst a prominent political action on a global level is required in order to mitigate the root causes (i.e. GHG emissions), national level efforts focus on adaptation (preparedness to the impacts of climate-induced hazards), and are forming part of the security agenda.Originality/valueThese issues are not restricted to the UK: understanding the role of security and its relationship to climate change becomes more pressing and urgent, as it informs the consequences of securitising climate change risks for development-disaster risk system.

T1  - Investigating car users' attitudes to climate change using multiple correspondence analysis
AN  - 2137115501
AB  - In recent years climate change and environmental issues have attracted worldwide attention and local, regional and national authorities, as well as policy makers, have accelerated their efforts to identify suitable emission reduction policies and measures. According to the UK Department for Transport, around a quarter of domestic carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to transport. Therefore, the UK Government has mandated reductions of 67% by 2050 over 2010 levels. This paper investigates car users' attitudes to and awareness of climate change to gain further understanding of how those attitudes relate to their travel behaviour. A comprehensive analysis of the British Social Attitude Survey (BSA) datasets of 2011 and 2014 was achieved by using a multi-faceted analytical approach which included Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Hierarchical Cluster analysis (HCA) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). The dimension reduction process by means of the EFA has resulted in three main factors: “traffic awareness”, “perceptions and actions, and “environmentally sensitive”. The HCA and MCA resulted in seven clusters that were based on car users socio–demographic and travel behaviour variables. The outcomes from the EFA, MCA and HCA were analysed further using MLR methods to investigate respondents' perceptions in greater depth and to relate them to their travel behaviour. These were used as main variables in the MLR analysis. Although 81% of respondents agreed that human actions are partly responsible for climate change impact as per the initial descriptive analysis, the MLR analysis revealed that the group described as ‘middle-aged males and females in full time employment’ and ‘older-aged males in retirement’ in 2014 exhibited an increased likelihood of holding a positive attitude towards “perceptions and actions” regarding climate change than the similarly described cohort in 2011. Intervention mechanisms to encourage mode shift to sustainable modes would be more likely to achieve success if tailored to this group.

T1  - Enhanced climate instability in the North Atlantic and southern Europe during the Last Interglacial
AN  - 2118789916
AB  - Considerable ambiguity remains over the extent and nature of millennial/centennial-scale climate instability during the Last Interglacial (LIG). Here we analyse marine and terrestrial proxies from a deep-sea sediment sequence on the Portuguese Margin and combine results with an intensively dated Italian speleothem record and climate-model experiments. The strongest expression of climate variability occurred during the transitions into and out of the LIG. Our records also document a series of multi-centennial intra-interglacial arid events in southern Europe, coherent with cold water-mass expansions in the North Atlantic. The spatial and temporal fingerprints of these changes indicate a reorganization of ocean surface circulation, consistent with low-intensity disruptions of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The amplitude of this LIG variability is greater than that observed in Holocene records. Episodic Greenland ice melt and runoff as a result of excess warmth may have contributed to AMOC weakening and increased climate instability throughout the LIG.

T1  - Development of a system for automated setup of a physically-based, spatially-distributed hydrological model for catchments in Great Britain
AN  - 2116838818
AB  - The use of physically-based spatially-distributed models to solve problems in hydrology has been limited by their intensive data and setup time requirements. We have therefore created a system that enables the automatic setup of a robust, physically-based spatially-distributed SHETRAN model for any catchment, gauged or ungauged, in Great Britain. National-scale datasets for topography, soil, landuse, geology and climate have been collated, processed and stored to allow rapid retrieval and configuration of catchment models with minimal user-intervention. These maps can be easily replaced by national datasets of other countries or global datasets, ensuring the system's international transferability. A graphical user interface has been developed to facilitate the model setup process. The resultant system, SHETRAN-GB, has the potential to significantly aid the deployment of SHETRAN for addressing important issues relating to water resources, hydrological extremes and climate change, either for individual or multiple catchments.

T1  - Impact of climate change on the transition of Neanderthals to modern humans in Europe
AN  - 2110459020
AB  - Two speleothem stable isotope records from East-Central Europe demonstrate that Greenland Stadial 12 (GS12) and GS10-at 44.3–43.3 and 40.8–40.2 ka-were prominent intervals of cold and arid conditions. GS12, GS11, and GS10 are coeval with a regional pattern of culturally (near-)sterile layers within Europe’s diachronous archeologic transition from Neanderthals to modern human Aurignacian. Sterile layers coeval with GS12 precede the Aurignacian throughout the middle and upper Danube region. In some records from the northern Iberian Peninsula, such layers are coeval with GS11 and separate the Châtelperronian from the Aurignacian. Sterile layers preceding the Aurignacian in the remaining Châtelperronian domain are coeval with GS10 and the previously reported 40.0- to 40.8-ka cal BP [calendar years before present (1950)] time range of Neanderthals’ disappearance from most of Europe. This suggests that ecologic stress during stadial expansion of steppe landscape caused a diachronous pattern of depopulation of Neanderthals, which facilitated repopulation by modern humans who appear to have been better adapted to this environment. Consecutive depopulation–repopulation cycles during severe stadials of the middle pleniglacial may principally explain the repeated replacement of Europe’s population and its genetic composition.

T1  - European ornamental garden flora as an invasion debt under climate change
AN  - 2131897797; IND606088610
AB  - Most naturalised and invasive alien plant species were originally introduced to regions for horticultural purposes. However, many regions now face an invasion debt from ornamental alien species, which have not yet naturalised. In this regard, climate change represents a threat as it may lower the barriers to naturalisation for some ornamental alien species. Identifying those species is extremely important for anticipating impending invasions. To identify predictors of naturalisation, we modelled the effects of climate, nursery availability and species characteristics on the current European naturalisation success of 2,073 ornamental aliens commonly planted in European gardens. We then used the resulting model together with climate projections for 2050 to forecast future naturalisation risks for the 1,583 species not yet naturalised in Europe. We found that non‐European naturalised range size, climatic suitability, propagule pressure, having a dioecious sexual system and plant height jointly explained current naturalisation success in Europe. By 2050, naturalisation probability projections increased by more than 0.1 for 41 species, and only decreased by more than 0.1 for one species. Policy implications. Using predictions based on our integrated model of alien ornamental naturalisation success, we identified species with high future naturalisation risk and species with high projected increases in naturalisation potential in Europe under climate change. This species list allows for prioritisation of monitoring and regulation of ornamental plants to mitigate the invasion debt.

T1  - Livestock Under Climate Change: A Systematic Review of Impacts and Adaptation
AN  - 2125335575
AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review to document the scientific knowledge about climate change impacts and adaptation in livestock systems, and to identify research gaps. The analysis was built from the premise that livestock offers substantial opportunities for food security and sustainable development if adaptation to climate change is appropriated. In examining 126 suitable peer-reviewed publications we discovered five research gaps: (1) a lack of research in Asia and South America; (2) a lack of mutual investigation and linkages between impacts and adaptation; (3) a lack of emphasis on mixed crop-livestock systems; (4) a lack of emphasis on monogastric livestock; and (5) an underrepresentation of quantitative methods including yield impact models. The findings suggest that the research on climate change impacts and adaptation in livestock systems needs to move beyond certain geographical contexts and consider key vulnerability priorities, particularly from developing countries. It is pivotal that research begins to jointly look at climate change impacts and the livestock keepers’ adaptation to draw out policy implications and to effectively target support for impact-specific adaptation options. Only if such evidence is established, adaptation will be appropriated accordingly to the needs of the livestock sector, and provision for the growing demand of animal-based products will be secured.

T1  - Examining associations between health, wellbeing and social capital: findings from a survey developed and conducted using participatory action research
TT  - Participatory action research
AN  - 2099052605
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to employ innovative methods to examine the associations between personal wellbeing, self-rated health and various aspects of social capital within a socio-economically disadvantaged town in northern England.Design/methodology/approachA survey was developed and administered with input from local stakeholders (including residents), using a participatory action research (PAR) approach. In total, 11 lay interviewers were trained to pilot and deliver the final survey, which was completed either in person or online. In total, 233 valid surveys were returned.FindingsRespondents were aged between 17 and 87 years (mean 47.3, SD 17.4), 65.7 per cent were female and 46.2 per cent identified themselves as having a longstanding illness, disability or infirmity. Overall, respondents reported lower levels of personal wellbeing and social capital in comparison with UK averages, although free-text responses highlighted a strong sense of community spirit and pride in the town. Low wellbeing was strongly associated with poor health, social isolation and neighbourhood factors such as perceived lack of community safety and trust.Research limitations/implicationsPAR appears to be an acceptable approach in generating estimates of population characteristics associated with personal wellbeing.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study may be used by policymakers to design services and interventions to better meet the needs of communities characterised by indicators of poor health and wellbeing.Originality/valueThis work constitutes part of a global trend to measure personal and societal wellbeing. A novel methodology has been used to examine the factors that influence wellbeing at a neighbourhood level.

T1  - European ornamental garden flora as an invasion debt under climate change
AN  - 2087492239
AB  - Most naturalised and invasive alien plant species were originally introduced to regions for horticultural purposes. However, many regions now face an invasion debt from ornamental alien species, which have not yet naturalised. In this regard, climate change represents a threat as it may lower the barriers to naturalisation for some ornamental alien species. Identifying those species is extremely important for anticipating impending invasions.To identify predictors of naturalisation, we modelled the effects of climate, nursery availability and species characteristics on the current European naturalisation success of 2,073 ornamental aliens commonly planted in European gardens. We then used the resulting model together with climate projections for 2050 to forecast future naturalisation risks for the 1,583 species not yet naturalised in Europe.We found that non‐European naturalised range size, climatic suitability, propagule pressure, having a dioecious sexual system and plant height jointly explained current naturalisation success in Europe. By 2050, naturalisation probability projections increased by more than 0.1 for 41 species, and only decreased by more than 0.1 for one species.Policy implications. Using predictions based on our integrated model of alien ornamental naturalisation success, we identified species with high future naturalisation risk and species with high projected increases in naturalisation potential in Europe under climate change. This species list allows for prioritisation of monitoring and regulation of ornamental plants to mitigate the invasion debt.

T1  - SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE WESTERN FLOWER THRIPS IN STRAWBERRY CROPS
AN  - 2136415259
AB  - Thrips are an ancient order of insects (order Thysanoptera) that have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. They are so adaptable that they are found from the Arctic to the tropics, feeding on a wide range of plant, animal and fungal hosts. Thrips are small in size, typically around 2mm long, and their delicate fringed wings make them weak fliers. This makes them unlikely candidates for causing devastating crop loss, yet thrips cause billions of pounds loss to the global economy every year. The most damaging species spread plant viruses, as well as causing direct feeding damage with their piercing-sucking mouthparts. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, is considered the most economically damaging of these on a global scale. This article explored why WFT has become such a devastating pest in one crop (strawberry) and how it can be managed in a sustainable way. Originally from western USA, WFT has spread rapidly around the world since the 1970s. Several factors have contributed to this spread: this highly adaptable species has been recorded on over 240 host plants including over 80 crop species, so it can establish in new habitats relatively easily; its ability to break down toxins has meant that it has developed resistance to all the pesticides commonly used against it; WFT evade capture by predators and humans by hiding in small cracks and crevices, which has allowed them to spread around the world through the increasingly global plant trade; global warming may also contribute to their gradual spread Northwards. WFT was first recorded in the UK in 1986, when it became a major pest of glasshouse crops such as cucumber, pepper and chrysanthemum. The occurrence in strawberry coincided with the increased use of polytunnels, which provide a warmer environment in which WFT thrive. At 25°C, adult WFT females have a 2-week generation time and lay about 7 eggs per day on a flowering strawberry crop, so the potential for a rapid population increase is massive, and growers can lose a crop in a short time when thrips are uncontrolled. Faced with this threat, growers turned initially to chemical insecticides, but with few chemicals available and increasing levels of pesticide resistance, control broke down and WFT became the most economically damaging pest of UK strawberry. Both adult and larval WFT feed on strawberry fruit, causing it to turn a bronze colour which makes it unmarketable. The annual loss of UK strawberry production due to WFT was estimated at 10–15%, with individual farmers losing entire crops. In a survey of growers, the breakdown in WFT control in UK strawberry crops could be linked to four main causes: 1. WFT has become resistant to all the pesticide products registered for use on strawberry. 2. There was a large carry-over of pests from the previous season in crops with poor control, either from over-wintered crops, or from reused, untreated growbags, resulting in damage following first-flowering. 3. Predators were released too late, or in insufficient quantities. 4. Crop protection products that are harmful to predators were used during the time when predatory mites were being used, or there was repeated use of slightly or moderately harmful pesticides, which prevented predator establishment and interrupted thrips control. Some growers consistently manage thrips with minimal fruit damage. These growers release predatory mites routinely from flowering, and combined biological control with mass trapping in one-year crops, and are careful to avoid broadspectrum, long-residual pesticides during the time when the predators were working. If insecticide treatment is required, these growers are careful to select products that will have limited impact on predators, then re-introduce predators after treatment. Therefore, the most effective approach to thrips control is to integrate all methods.

T1  - Networks, advocacy and evidence in public health policymaking: insights from case studies of European Union smoke-free and English health inequalities policy debates
AN  - 2120820690
AB  - The past two decades witnessed the international consensus around the idea that health policy decisions should be 'evidence-based'. These efforts have stimulated a wealth of studies explicitly concerned with understanding the use of research evidence in policy. The majority of such studies suggest there are few examples of public health policy outcomes that might reasonably be labelled 'evidence-based'. Only a small number of these studies seek to explore how political dynamics interacted with evidence to shape policy outcomes. Here, we draw on two empirical case studies of efforts to promote public health evidence to decision makers (protection from secondhand smoke in Europe and tackling health inequalities in England), to highlight the primacy of 'policy networks' and 'advocacy' for understanding the role of evidence in achieving policy change. Reflecting on our empirical findings, we argue that the policy networks literature usefully foregrounds the roles that diverse 'policy actors' can play in connecting research and policy. However, our case studies also suggest that popular accounts of policy networks, such as Haas' 'epistemic communities' and Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith's Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), overstate the role of core values in driving policy network efforts, while underplaying the role of advocacy, leadership, network communication and trust, scientific consensus, political context and strategic policy trade-offs in network success. We conclude by arguing for further efforts to connect analyses of policy networks and evidence use. We also reflect on the implications of our findings for those seeking to employ evidence to effect policy change.

T1  - Incipient road to extinction of a keystone herbivore in south-eastern Europe: Harting’s vole (Microtus hartingi) under climate change
AN  - 2077253798
AB  - Climate forcing, which is blamed for the decennial decline in the dynamics of vole populations in Central and Northern Europe, may have similar effects in southern (Mediterranean) Europe, even more so since the region is especially vulnerable to global change. In the absence of population monitoring, we investigated the temporal development and geospatial pattern of the habitat of Harting’s vole (Microtus hartingi) in southeast Europe (SEE) by relying on data regarding its presence, the most recent freely available geospatial datasets and state-of-the-art presence-only Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques. Results indicate that (1) the potential habitat of Harting’s vole was perhaps stable over the last 6000 years - modelling predictions are in conjunction with scarce fossil evidence, which points to repeated colonisations from Asia Minor punctuated by extinctions in SEE; (2) fragmentation of the potential habitat in SEE, which may have already begun in the Last Glacial Maximum, and will most likely continue in the near future; and (3) Harting’s vole could disappear by the end of the century if more pessimistic climate change scenarios become reality. While climate change is suppressing the population dynamics of the keystone grass-eating voles from temperate and boreal ecosystems, it is about to annihilate their Mediterranean counterpart. This will result in a far more severe impact on community restructuring in the Mediterranean ecosystems than elsewhere. Long-term population monitoring is desperately needed in SEE to hone the ability to more accurately predict the impacts of climate change.

T1  - Is Ethical Finance the Answer to the Ills of the UK Financial Market? A Post-Crisis Analysis: JBE
AN  - 2073955773
AB  - The 2008 financial crisis exposed the dark side of the financial sector in the UK. It brought attention to the contaminated culture of the business, which accommodated the systemic malpractices that largely contributed to the financial turmoil of 2008. In the wake of the crisis there seems to be a wide consensus that this contaminated culture can no longer be accepted and needs to change. This article examines the ills of the UK financial market, more specifically the cultural contamination problem, which was uncovered by the 2008 financial crisis, in order to explore its genesis and the suitable solutions for it. In this regard, the article analyses the ethical finance sector from theoretical and practical perspectives in order to assess its role in addressing the cultural contamination problem of the UK financial market.

T1  - Business models for residential retrofit in the UK: a critical assessment of five key archetypes
AN  - 2015614550
AB  - The comprehensive retrofit of residential buildings has significant potential to reduce carbon emissions and provide additional heath and economic benefits. However, in countries such as the UK, much of this potential is yet to be realised. This paper shows how the concept of ‘business models’ (BMs) can be a powerful tool for understanding the challenge of improving energy performance and reducing carbon emissions in residential buildings. Through a review of contemporary literature and 18 semi-structured interviews, the paper describes and compares five distinct BM archetypes: the atomised market model, market intermediation model, one-stop-shop, energy services agreement and managed energy services agreement. These models range from the traditional approach to highly innovative energy service contracts. The paper further illustrates how the UK and EU market for retrofitting residential buildings is beginning to trial the more innovative BMs. These emerging BMs are characterised by increasingly industrialised processes and integrated supply chains, a holistic customer offering and single point of sale, long-term energy-saving performance contracts (ESPC) and integral project finance. It is argued that whilst the traditional BM is suitable for the implementation of single or piecemeal energy-saving measures, BM innovation will be required to meet the UK’s ambitious climate change targets.

T1  - Land cover and vegetation data from an ecological survey of “key habitat” landscapes in England, 1992–1993
AN  - 2414599414
AB  - Since 1978, a series of national surveys (Countryside Survey, CS) have been carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) (formerly the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, ITE) to gather data on the natural environment in Great Britain (GB). As the sampling framework for these surveys is not optimised to yield data on rarer or more localised habitats, a survey was commissioned by the then Department of the Environment (DOE, now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA) in the 1990s to carry out additional survey work in English landscapes which contained semi-natural habitats that were perceived to be under threat, or which represented areas of concern to the ministry. The landscapes were lowland heath, chalk and limestone (calcareous) grasslands, coasts and uplands. The information recorded allowed an assessment of the extent and quality of a range of habitats defined during the project, which can now be translated into standard UK broad and priority habitat classes. The survey, known as the “Key Habitat Survey”, followed a design which was a series of gridded, stratified, randomly selected 1 km squares taken as representative of each of the four landscape types in England, determined from statistical land classification and geological data (“spatial masks”). The definitions of the landscapes are given in the descriptions of the spatial masks, along with definitions of the surveyed habitats. A total of 213 of the 1 km2 square sample sites were surveyed in the summers of 1992 and 1993, with information being collected on vegetation species, land cover, landscape features and land use, applying standardised repeatable methods. The database contributes additional information and value to the long-term monitoring data gathered by the Countryside Survey and provides a valuable baseline against which future ecological changes may be compared, offering the potential for a repeat survey. The data were analysed and described in a series of contract reports and are summarised in the present paper, showing for example that valuable habitats were restricted in all landscapes, with the majority located within protected areas of countryside according to different UK designations. The dataset provides major potential for analyses, beyond those already published, for example in relation to climate change, agri-environment policies and land management. Precise locations of the plots are restricted, largely for reasons of landowner confidentiality. However, the representative nature of the dataset makes it highly valuable for evaluating the status of ecological elements within the associated landscapes surveyed. Both land cover data and vegetation plot data were collected during the surveys in 1992 and 1993 and are available via the following DOI:https://doi.org/10.5285/7aefe6aa-0760-4b6d-9473-fad8b960abd4. The spatial masks are also available fromhttps://doi.org/10.5285/dc583be3-3649-4df6-b67e-b0f40b4ec895.

T1  - Keeping expertise in its place: understanding arm's-length bodies as boundary organisations
AN  - 2120814630
AB  - Policy and administration scholars have struggled to explain the waxing and waning of arm's-length bodies over time and across contexts. This article draws on the science and technology studies's concept of boundary work – understood as practices which both demarcate and enable collaboration across distinct areas of expertise – to help explain variation in these institutional arrangements. Conceptualising arm's-length bodies as boundary organisations shows how their authority rests on their capacity to enable ongoing coordination while preserving the authority and autonomy of relevant expert spheres. The article demonstrates this analytical purchase through reference to two cases in contemporary British government.

T1  - Predicting marsh vulnerability to sea-level rise using Holocene relative sea-level data
AN  - 2068894450
AB  - Tidal marshes rank among Earth’s vulnerable ecosystems, which will retreat if future rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) exceed marshes’ ability to accrete vertically. Here, we assess the limits to marsh vulnerability by analyzing >780 Holocene reconstructions of tidal marsh evolution in Great Britain. These reconstructions include both transgressive (tidal marsh retreat) and regressive (tidal marsh expansion) contacts. The probability of a marsh retreat was conditional upon Holocene rates of RSLR, which varied between −7.7 and 15.2 mm/yr. Holocene records indicate that marshes are nine times more likely to retreat than expand when RSLR rates are ≥7.1 mm/yr. Coupling estimated probabilities of marsh retreat with projections of future RSLR suggests a major risk of tidal marsh loss in the twenty-first century. All of Great Britain has a >80% probability of a marsh retreat under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 by 2100, with areas of southern and eastern England achieving this probability by 2040.

T1  - Tritrophic phenological match–mismatch in space and time
AN  - 2389669631
AB  - Increasing temperatures associated with climate change may generate phenological mismatches that disrupt previously synchronous trophic interactions. Most work on mismatch has focused on temporal trends, whereas spatial variation in the degree of trophic synchrony has largely been neglected, even though the degree to which mismatch varies in space has implications for meso-scale population dynamics and evolution. Here we quantify latitudinal trends in phenological mismatch, using phenological data on an oak–caterpillar–bird system from across the UK. Increasing latitude delays phenology of all species, but more so for oak, resulting in a shorter interval between leaf emergence and peak caterpillar biomass at northern locations. Asynchrony found between peak caterpillar biomass and peak nestling demand of blue tits, great tits and pied flycatchers increases in earlier (warm) springs. There is no evidence of spatial variation in the timing of peak nestling demand relative to peak caterpillar biomass for any species. Phenological mismatch alone is thus unlikely to explain spatial variation in population trends. Given projections of continued spring warming, we predict that temperate forest birds will become increasingly mismatched with peak caterpillar timing. Latitudinal invariance in the direction of mismatch may act as a double-edged sword that presents no opportunities for spatial buffering from the effects of mismatch on population size, but generates spatially consistent directional selection on timing, which could facilitate rapid evolutionary change.Most work on phenological mismatch has focused on temporal trends only. Here, the authors analyse trends in spatial and temporal mismatch between trees, caterpillars and birds in the UK, and find delayed phenology of all species with increasing latitude and little spatial variation in the magnitude of mismatch between caterpillars and birds.

T1  - Stakeholders' perception of the relevance of water and sediment connectivity in water and land management
AN  - 2101389194; IND605982555
AB  - Using concepts of connectivity in challenges regarding land and water management (flooding, erosion, nutrient leaching, landslides) can only be fully harnessed if knowledge is communicated well between scientists and stakeholders. Proper communication requires prior understanding of end‐users' perception of connectivity as a useful framework. Therefore, we analysed (a) perceptions of ‘connectivity’ for stakeholders involved in water and land management across Europe, (b) potential for stakeholders to apply connectivity‐related measures in their management decisions, (c) stakeholders' biggest challenges in water and land management, and (d) stakeholders' expectations for future connectivity research agendas. We studied 85 questionnaires from 19 countries using a grounded theory approach. One third of stakeholders understood connectivity in its scientific context, whereas 39% perceived connectivity indirectly through their personal experiences (e.g., water and sediment fluxes and erosion). Half of stakeholders' perceived links and challenges were related to availability of data and methods, communication, and institutions or policy, whereas others believed they were related to water quality and quantity, soil erosion and quality, and climate change. Half of the stakeholders considered connectivity management important, and one third showed high interest in managing connectivity. Adopting connectivity into management is hindered by institutional‐ and policy‐based management limitations, insufficient data and methods, and ineffective knowledge transfer. Explicitly considering heterogeneity of stakeholder perceptions is required for projects regarding management of connectivity at European, national, and local scales.

T1  - Experiences of rail intermodal freight transport for low-density high value (LDHV) goods in Europe
AN  - 2053226184
AB  - ObjectivePrevious studies have suggested an upward growth trend in low density, high value (LDHV) goods in Europe. Such goods require time sensitive, reliable services and currently, most LDHV goods are transported by road. The paper presents the findings of four case studies which detail the barriers and enablers to intermodal rail services for transporting LDHV goods.MethodologyWe applied a methodological pluralism, quantitative and qualitative, on an inductive basis. Using a case study approach, the research investigates the requirements of shippers, identifies key barriers to intermodal rail service offerings and, based on the findings, suggests enablers for intermodal rail freight transport. The current research applies parallel top down and bottom up streams, with a final integration synthesis.FindingsTerminals may appear as an important barrier or enabler towards achieving a competitive intermodal rail service. By making rail terminal as an enabler, the research suggests that it is possible to carry LDHV goods by intermodal rail in a cost-efficient manner. The research attempts to seek a potential innovative solution to the barriers identified. The research compares road with an intermodal rail-road solution, in terms of cost and time, for a door-to-door service along the selected routes/corridors.RecommendationThe research recommends that technical solutions, such as automated transhipment and temperature controlled systems, are required for rail freight services for LDHV goods, but that they must be complemented by collaborative operational solutions and viable service planning for an intermodal rail transport service to be reliable and competitive with road transport.

T1  - Phenological changes of the most commonly sampled ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) species in the UK environmental change network
AN  - 2015461152
AB  - Despite the important roles ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) play in ecosystems, the highly valued ecosystem services they provide, and ample descriptive documentation of their phenology, the relative impact of various environmental factors on carabid phenology is not well studied. Using the long-term pitfall trap capture data from 12 terrestrial Environmental Change Network (ECN) sites from the UK, we examined how changing climate influenced the phenology of common carabids, and the role particular climate components had on phenological parameters. Of the 28 species included in the analyses, 19 showed earlier start of their activity. This advance was particularly pronounced in the spring, supporting the view that early phenophases have a greater tendency to change and these changes are more directly controlled by temperature than later ones. Autumn activity extended only a few cases, suggesting a photoperiod-driven start of hibernation. No association was found between life-history traits and the ability of species to change their phenology. Air temperatures between April and June were the most important factors determining the start of activity of each species, whilst late season precipitation hastened the cessation of activity. The balance between the advantages and disadvantages of changing phenology on various levels is likely to depend on the species and even on local environmental criteria. The substantially changing phenology of Carabidae may influence their function in ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide.

T1  - Retrofitting options for wastewater networks to achieve climate change reduction targets
AN  - 2053893670; IND605927200
AB  - An alternate approach to urban and regional planning is presented that considers the wastewater infrastructure from an energy consumption and carbon production perspective. The existing wastewater infrastructure from four counties in North East England region is investigated, which includes energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) data from 87 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (16 activated sludge (AS) and 71 biofilter (BF) plants) and 196 pump stations across the region. This study provides a rigorous and novel way of justifying new investments for retrofitting treatment technologies to the wastewater network. Mass and energy balances are performed across the network utilising a spread-sheet based model. Overall, energy use and CO2 emissions are greatest in biological wastewater treatment (relative to other network elements) with estimated median levels of 0.37 kWh/m3 and 0.40 kg-CO2/m3, respectively, per waste volume processed. However, energy-use and CO2 emissions differed according to treatment technology with AS plants using significantly more energy (median = 0.4 kWh/m3) and producing more CO2 (median = 0.4 kg-CO2/m3) than BF plants (medians: 0.2 kWh/m3 and 0.3 kg-CO2/m3, respectively). Hence, directed interventions within WWTPs themselves will have the greatest positive influence on energy use and CO2 emissions. Given water companies are often locked-in with their infrastructure, retrofitting existing treatment networks is strongly suggested. For example, adding BF pre-treatment to existing AS plants will reduce energy use, whereas anaerobic or photosynthetic technologies may be useful for reducing energy and CO2 emissions in new-builds. This study confirms energy and carbon dioxide inefficiencies exist in modern wastewater networks, but uniquely identifies targeted actions to reduce inefficiencies, especially retrofitting existing WWTPs to reduce CO2 emitted and energy used in the wastewater infrastructure to make major advances towards achieving climate change reduction targets.

T1  - Rapid fuel switching from coal to natural gas through effective carbon pricing
AN  - 2137522498
AB  - Great Britain’s overall carbon emissions fell by 6% in 2016, due to cleaner electricity production. This was not due to a surge in low-carbon nuclear or renewable sources; instead it was the much-overlooked impact of fuel switching from coal to natural gas generation. This Perspective considers the enabling conditions in Great Britain and the potential for rapid fuel switching in other coal-reliant countries. We find that spare generation and fuel supply-chain capacity must already exist for fuel switching to deliver rapid carbon savings, and to avoid further high-carbon infrastructure lock-in. More important is the political will to alter the marketplace and incentivize this switch, for example, through a stable and strong carbon price. With the right incentives, fuel switching in the power sector could rapidly achieve on the order of 1 GtCO2 saving per year worldwide (3% of global emissions), buying precious time to slow the growth in cumulative carbon emissions.

T1  - Bridging the gap between domain of research and locus of impact
AN  - 2033296056
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the relevance of academic research in the business and management studies stream to various stakeholders. The stakeholder theory is used to examine the influence of research on various key beneficiaries and investigate the link between the domain of research and locus of impact.Design/methodology/approachResearch Excellence Framework 2014 (REF 2014) conducted in the UK provides a useful context and data for our research as REF 2014 encouraged universities to submit the information on research activities and their beneficiaries. This information is in the form of impact case studies which details the research, location of research and beneficiaries.FindingsThe findings suggest that research with an international focus has a positive impact on industry stakeholders, especially multinational corporations as well as non-governmental organizations. Second, it shows how research has made a commercial impact in innovation and small and medium enterprises’ growth while having limited impact on other domains such as social, legal, political and healthcare. More broadly, the findings indicate the degree of regional diversity. Also, the wider results-driven agenda in the UK can overestimate the research contribution to some stakeholders in the society.Research limitations/implicationsSelf-selection bias as universities might submit only few case studies.Practical implicationsFor research to generate long-term benefits for the wider society, it needs to engage more deeply with the whole range of stakeholders.Originality/valueThis study contributes to understanding how research is consumed by stakeholders. The results indicate that while locally relevant research encourages local consumption; it is not assimilated across various stakeholders.

T1  - When Will We Detect Changes in Short-Duration Precipitation Extremes?
AN  - 2117984176
AB  - The question of when the influence of climate change on U.K. rainfall extremes may be detected is important from a planning perspective, providing a time scale for necessary climate change adaptation measures. Short-duration intense rainfall is responsible for flash flooding, and several studies have suggested an amplified response to warming for rainfall extremes on hourly and subhourly time scales. However, there are very few studies examining the detection of changes in subdaily rainfall. This is due to the high cost of very high-resolution (kilometer scale) climate models needed to capture hourly rainfall extremes and to a lack of sufficiently long, high-quality, subdaily observational records. Results using output from a 1.5-km climate model over the southern United Kingdom indicate that changes in 10-min and hourly precipitation emerge before changes in daily precipitation. In particular, model results suggest detection times for short-duration rainfall intensity in the 2040s in winter and the 2080s in summer, which are, respectively, 5-10 years and decades earlier than for daily extremes. Results from a new quality-controlled observational dataset of hourly rainfall over the United Kingdom do not show a similar difference between daily and hourly trends. Natural variability appears to dominate current observed trends (including an increase in the intensity of heavy summer rainfall over the last 30 years), with some suggestion of larger daily than hourly trends for recent decades. The expectation of the reverse, namely, larger trends for short-duration rainfall, as the signature of underlying climate change has potentially important implications for detection and attribution studies.

T1  - ADDRESSING INTERSECTIONAL VULNERABILITIES IN CONTEMPORARY REFUGEE MOVEMENTS IN EUROPE
TT  - Naslavljanje intersečnih ranljivosti v sodobnih begunskih gibanjih v Evropi
AN  - 2104912356
AB  - The article explores the heterogeneity and complexity of contemporary refugee movements in Europe by analysing in particular the situation along the Balkan corridor, investigating the complex intersections of gender, age, ethnic affiliation, and other aspects reflecting the situation of individuals on the move. It focuses on construction of the vulnerability of individuals and social groups. Unlike restrictive policies, which reduce mobility, we perceive migrations as autonomous processes. Through an analysis of secondary data, reports and research, the article challenges the policies of selecting migrants based on their legal status, using restrictive borders and transferring the external borders of the Schengen area into the internal territories of the member states - in our case, along the Balkan corridor.Alternate abstract:V besedilu zlasti na primeru balkanske poti obravnavamo heterogenost in kompleksnost sodobnih begunskih gibanj v Evropi ter naslavljamo pomembne intersečnosti med spolom, starostjo, etničnim izvorom in drugimi statusi, ki uokvirjajo položaj ljudi na poti. Poudarek je na vprašanju konstrukcije ranljivosti posameznikov in družbenih skupin. Pri tem izhajamo iz perspektive migracij kot avtonomnih procesov nasproti restriktivnim politikam omejevanja mobilnosti. Besedilo z analizo sekundarnih podatkov in raziskav problematizira politike selekcioniranja migrantov na temelju pravnih statusov, restriktivne meje in prenos modela zunanjih schengenskih meja na notranja ozemlja, v našem primeru na Balkanski koridor.

T1  - A survey of Scottish fishermen ahead of Brexit: political, social and constitutional attitudes
AN  - 2039616364
AB  - There is a substantial amount of literature that focuses on the governance of offshore fisheries in Europe and abroad, the history of fishing industries in different countries, and anthropological studies of fishing communities around the world. There is also a large amount of literature that explores the attitudes of fishermen towards fisheries governance and management. However, there is very little research that has explored the political attitudes of fishermen through the use of quantitative survey data. Using a survey carried out just ahead of the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, this paper analyses data from a sample of Scottish skippers who work on vessels over 10 m in length. The paper focuses on how fishermen in Scotland vote at both UK and Scottish elections, how they voted in the Scottish independence and EU referendums, their political and social attitudes and their demographic breakdown. On the EU referendum, the paper finds that fishermen, as well intending to overwhelmingly voting to leave the EU, did so for instrumental reasons in the belief that this course of action would benefit them and their industry.

T1  - Dash for Gas: Climate Change, Hegemony and the Scalar Politics of Fracking in the UK
AN  - 2025004540
AB  - This paper investigates the political contestation over hydraulic fracturing of shale gas, or ‘fracking’, in the UK. Based on an analysis of four public inquiries, it shows how both proponents and opponents of fracking employed scaling to mobilize interests by connecting (or disconnecting) fracking to spatial and temporal scales. The analysis explains how a fossil fuel hegemony was reproduced by linking local and specific benefits to nationally or globally recognized interests such as employment, energy security and emission reductions. The paper contributes to recent debates on environmental political contestation by showing how scaling enables the linkage of competing interests by alternating between spatial (e.g. local vs. global) and temporal (e.g. short term vs. long term) horizons. The authors argue that scaling allows dominant actors to uphold contradictory positions on climate change, which contributes to explaining the current disastrous political climate impasse.

T1  - Influence of industrial activity and pollution on the paleoclimate reconstruction from a eutrophic lake in lowland England, UK
AN  - 2009485197
AB  - Reliable estimates of Holocene temperatures are important for understanding past climate dynamics, the response of biota to climate change, and validating climate models. Chironomids in lake sediment cores are used widely to quantify past summer temperatures, for which high-latitude and/or high-altitude lakes, remote from human influence, are usually considered appropriate. Temperature inferences from lowland lakes are likely influenced by other variables, specifically eutrophication and industrial pollution, but their reliability has never been tested. We used a Norwegian chironomid-based transfer function (r2 = 0.91; RMSEP = 1.01 °C) to infer mean July air temperature over the last 200 years, using chironomid assemblages in a core collected from a polluted, nutrient-enriched lake at Speke Hall, Liverpool, England. The chironomid-inferred temperatures correlate significantly with the local instrumental temperature record and follow long-term national temperature trends. These results show that chironomids can be used to produce reliable estimates of past mean July air temperature, even when other variables have also influenced the composition of the chironomid community. These findings underline the value of chironomids as sensitive and reliable quantitative proxies for summer temperature.

Their implicit hypothesis that policy organisations share the same epistemic perspective as they do, and that the reason there are few RCTs are due to a set of barriers to be overcome is examined in relation to the UK government Department of Energy and Climate Change. Drawing on the author’s experience of working in the ministry, the claim that barriers are a reason for preventing RCT use is discounted. An alternative explanation is presented, framed around the idea of an ‘energy policy epistemology’ that legitimately places certain specific knowledge demands and ways of knowing on research and evaluation designs. Through examination of a specific set of research and evaluation outputs related to the UK energy efficiency policy called the ‘Green Deal’, aspects of the proposed ‘energy policy epistemology’ are elucidated to explain the lack of demand for RCT designs. Final consideration is given to what kinds of designs are more likely to gain support in this context that might also deliver many of the benefits attributed to RCTs with longitudinal panels being one important example.

T1  - Large-Scale Predictors for Extreme Hourly Precipitation Events in Convection-Permitting Climate Simulations
AN  - 2117969989
AB  - Midlatitude extreme precipitation events are caused by well-understood meteorological drivers, such as vertical instability and low pressure systems. In principle, dynamical weather and climate models behave in the same way, although perhaps with the sensitivities to the drivers varying between models. Unlike parameterized convection models (PCMs), convection-permitting models (CPMs) are able to realistically capture subdaily extreme precipitation. CPMs are computationally expensive; being able to diagnose the occurrence of subdaily extreme precipitation from large-scale drivers, with sufficient skill, would allow effective targeting of CPM downscaling simulations. Here the regression relationships are quantified between the occurrence of extreme hourly precipitation events and vertical stability and circulation predictors in southern United Kingdom 1.5-km CPM and 12-km PCM present- and future-climate simulations. Overall, the large-scale predictors demonstrate skill in predicting the occurrence of extreme hourly events in both the 1.5- and 12-km simulations. For the present-climate simulations, extreme occurrences in the 12-km model are less sensitive to vertical stability than in the 1.5-km model, consistent with understanding the limitations of cumulus parameterization. In the future-climate simulations, the regression relationship is more similar between the two models, which may be understood from changes to the large-scale circulation patterns and land surface climate. Overall, regression analysis offers a promising avenue for targeting CPM simulations. The authors also outline which events would be missed by adopting such a targeted approach.

T1  - Exploring the current position of ESD in UK higher education institutions
AN  - 2533998179
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to consider the position of education for sustainable development in the UK Higher Education (HE) sector with respect to the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) and Higher Education Academy (HEA) Guidance for education for sustainable development (ESD).Design/methodology/approachBy means of a mixed-method approach underpinned by a concurrent triangulation design strategy, this research presents evidence from an online questionnaire survey and in-depth semi-structured interviews.FindingsInsights are presented from case studies of a group of UK Higher Education Institute (HEIs) which have made significant progress in embedding ESD in the curricula.Research limitations/implicationsCentral to this study is an exploration of the ESD integration process of this group including a description of the approaches to integration, the challenges faced and overcome and the critical success factors. It examines the role of a guidance instrument in simplifying and accelerating the ESD curricular integration process. The results of the study show that there is a multitude of integration approaches applied varying in their emphasis.Practical implicationsThe main challenge HEIs face is engaging staff that may question the relevance of the ESD concept, and that lack an understanding regarding its implications for their discipline. Critical success factors identified are institution-wide people support, high-level institutional support and funding. The QAA and HEA guidance has successfully supported HEIs in developing their ESD commitments.Originality/valueThe results of this research can support HEIs in developing their own approach to ESD, as they learn from similar UK HE providers, particularly with respect to overcoming barriers and enhancing critical success factors to ESD curricular integration.

T1  - Assessment of the Mineral Resource Potential of Atlantic Ferromanganese Crusts Based on Their Growth History, Microstructure, and Texture
AN  - 2582829920
AB  - The decarbonisation of our energy supply is reliant on new technologies that are raw material intensive and will require a significant increase in the production of metals to sustain them. Ferromanganese (FeMn) crusts are seafloor precipitates, enriched in metals such as cobalt and tellurium, both of which have a predicted future demand above current production rates. In this study, we investigate the texture and composition of FeMn crusts on Tropic Seamount, a typical Atlantic guyot off the coast of western Africa, as a basis for assessing the future mineral resource potential of Atlantic Seamounts. The majority of the summit is flat and covered by FeMn crusts with average thicknesses of 3–4 cm. The crusts are characterized by two dominant textures consisting of either massive pillared growth or more chaotic, cuspate sections of FeMn oxides, with an increased proportion of detrital and organic material. The Fe, Mn, and Co contents in the FeMn oxide layers are not affected by texture. However, detrital material and bioclasts can form about 50% of cuspate areas, and the dilution effect of this entrained material considerably reduces the Fe, Mn, and Co concentrations if the bulk samples are analyzed. Whilst Tropic Seamount meets many of the prerequisites for a crust mining area, the thickness of the crusts and their average metal composition means extraction is unlikely to be viable in the near future. The ability to exploit more difficult terrains or multiple, closely spaced edifices would make economic feasibility more likely.

T1  - Multi-Country Analysis on Energy Savings in Buildings by Means of a Micro-Solar Organic Rankine Cycle System: A Simulation Study
AN  - 2582801681
AB  - In this paper, the smart management of buildings energy use by means of an innovative renewable micro-cogeneration system is investigated. The system consists of a concentrated linear Fresnel reflectors solar field coupled with a phase change material thermal energy storage tank and a 2 kWe/18 kWth organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system. The microsolar ORC was designed to supply both electricity and thermal energy demand to residential dwellings to reduce their primary energy use. In this analysis, the achievable energy and operational cost savings through the proposed plant with respect to traditional technologies (i.e., condensing boilers and electricity grid) were assessed by means of simulations. The influence of the climate and latitude of the installation was taken into account to assess the performance and the potential of such system across Europe and specifically in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, U.K., and Sweden. Results show that the proposed plant can satisfy about 80% of the overall energy demand of a 100 m2 dwelling in southern Europe, while the energy demand coverage drops to 34% in the worst scenario in northern Europe. The corresponding operational cost savings amount to 87% for a dwelling in the south and at 33% for one in the north.

T1  - Community Food Growing in Parks? Assessing the Acceptability and Feasibility in Sheffield, UK
AN  - 2110062078
AB  - Urbanisation brings with it increased pressure on land and land uses, particularly green spaces. There has been considerable interest in community food growing in green spaces as part of a wide trend for gardening in the UK, which has been found to bring social, health, and well-being benefits. Such activity tends to take place in community-managed gardens and allotments. In light of the context of austerity within which local authority parks departments currently operate, this study tested the acceptability and feasibility of parks as a potential urban setting for Community Food Growing (CFG) in Sheffield, UK. Employing a combination of resident questionnaires and interviews with community groups and professionals, the study results showed localised differences in the acceptability and feasibility of CFG. Residents’ propensity to want to get involved in CFG differed by age and household composition, which, if acted on across the city, could significantly change the demographic make-up of parks-based community groups in the city. Barriers to CFG in parks were described by community groups and park managers as security and vandalism, need for resources, and undue pressure on the local authority as land-owner. We discuss the emergent questions around who is best placed to manage urban parks, particularly when the public sector is subject to stringent austerity budget measures. The paper concludes with commentary and recommendations about the importance of governance arrangements if CFG is to be included as part of the activities supported and managed in urban parks.

T1  - Contrasting Regional Habitats for Urban Sustainability Experimentation in Europe
AN  - 2108741380
AB  - The sustainability challenge requires experimentation with innovations, followed by an upscaling process towards a broader regime change in the long term. In Europe we observe various regional hotspots for sustainability experimentation which suggests that there are favorable spatial contexts. Little is known about why different kinds of experiments flourish or fail in various spatial contexts. In this paper we explore these contexts by using the habitat concept. A habitat is regarded as the configuration of favorable local and regional context factors for experimentation. To capture the diversity of these habitats we have constructed archetypical experimentation patterns. These patterns are built up of five dimensions: knowledge, governance, informal institutions, regional innovation advantages, and social learning. In a comparative case study in four city regions in Europe we find a large contrast in habitats. Countercultures play an important role, as they shape a beneficial context for experimentation through alternative ideas and lifestyles. We also find indications that it is important that a combination of several habitat factors is present, and that these factors have aligned and evolved over several years of experimentation, thus leading to a more mature habitat. The research suggests that regional stakeholders can positively influence most of the habitat factors shaping future upscaling. However, there are also some important factors, such as regional knowledge and skills, which have a path-dependent nature and are more difficult to improve in the short term.

T1  - A Framework for the Selection of Optimum Offshore Wind Farm Locations for Deployment
AN  - 2108519337
AB  - This research develops a framework to assist wind energy developers to select the optimum deployment site of a wind farm by considering the Round 3 available zones in the UK. The framework includes optimization techniques, decision-making methods and experts’ input in order to support investment decisions. Further, techno-economic evaluation, life cycle costing (LCC) and physical aspects for each location are considered along with experts’ opinions to provide deeper insight into the decision-making process. A process on the criteria selection is also presented and seven conflicting criteria are being considered for implementation in the technique for the order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method in order to suggest the optimum location that was produced by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII). For the given inputs, Seagreen Alpha, near the Isle of May, was found to be the most probable solution, followed by Moray Firth Eastern Development Area 1, near Wick, which demonstrates by example the effectiveness of the newly introduced framework that is also transferable and generic. The outcomes are expected to help stakeholders and decision makers to make better informed and cost-effective decisions under uncertainty when investing in offshore wind energy in the UK.

T1  - Influence of the Scandinavian climate pattern on the UK asthma mortality: a time series and geospatial study
AN  - 2099461555
AB  - ObjectiveIt is well known that climate variability and trends have an impact on human morbidity and mortality, especially during the winter. However, there are only a handful of studies that have undertaken quantitative investigations into this impact. We evaluate the association between the UK winter asthma mortality data to a well-established feature of the climate system, the Scandinavian (SCA) pattern.MethodsTime series analysis of monthly asthma mortality through the period of January 2001 to December 2015 was conducted, where the data were acquired from the UK’s Office for National Statistics. The correlations between indices of important modes of climate variability impacting the UK such as the North Atlantic Oscillation as well as the SCA and the asthma mortality time series were computed. A grid point correlation analysis was also conducted with the asthma data with sea level pressure, surface wind and temperature data acquired from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.ResultsWe find that sea level pressure and temperature fluctuations associated with the SCA explain ~20% (>95% CL) of variance in the UK asthma mortality through a period of 2001–2015. Furthermore, the highest winter peak in asthma mortality occurred in the year 2015, during which there were strong northwesterly winds over the UK that were the result of a sea level pressure pattern similar to that associated with the SCA.ConclusionsOur study emphasises the importance of incorporating large-scale geospatial analyses into future research of understanding diseases and its environmental impact on human health.
