T1  - Temporal dynamics of ecosystem, inherent, and underlying water use efficiencies of forests, grasslands, and croplands and their responses to climate change
AN  - 2837225425
AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding temporal trends and varying responses of water use efficiency (WUE) to environmental changes of diverse ecosystems is key to predicting vegetation growth. WUE dynamics of major ecosystem types (e.g., forest, grassland and cropland) have been studied using various WUE definitions/metrics, but a comparative study on WUE dynamics and their driving forces among different ecosystem types using multiple WUE metrics is lacking. We used eddy covariance measurements for 42 FLUXNET2015 sites (396 site years) from 1997 to 2014, as well as three commonly used WUE metrics (i.e., ecosystem, inherent, and underlying WUE) to investigate the commonalities and differences in WUE trends and driving factors among deciduous broadleaf forests (DBFs), evergreen needleleaf forests (ENFs), grasslands, and croplands.ResultsOur results showed that the temporal trends of WUE were not statistically significant at 73.8% of the forest, grassland and cropland sites, and none of the three WUE metrics exhibited better performance than the others in quantifying WUE. Meanwhile, the trends observed for the three WUE metrics were not significantly different among forest, grassland and cropland ecosystems. In addition, WUE was mainly driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at sites with significant WUE trends, and by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at sites without significant trends (except cropland).ConclusionsOur findings revealed the commonalities and differences in the application of three WUE metrics in disparate ecosystems, and further highlighted the important effect of VPD on WUE change.

T1  - Volcanic impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean
AN  - 2814227302
AB  - Natural disturbances such as volcanic eruptions provide a unique opportunity to study past ecological dynamics. Here we illustrate the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to volcanic eruptions in connection to prevailing climate conditions. We selected five volcaniclastic depositions in the Lake Van (Turkey) sediments from different interglacial/glacial periods (Marine Isotope Stages 3 to 9e). Using high-resolution pollen data, non-pollen palynomorphs, and microscopic charcoal particles we attempted to disentangle climatic and volcanic forcing of natural environmental disturbances. Our results highlights that the thickness of subsequent volcanic deposits and the respective climatic conditions strongly influence the impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The most common response to ash deposition is a shift towards herbaceous taxa and abrupt fire activity. The affected herbaceous vegetation recovers to pre-eruption levels in 20 to 40 varve-years. The lake water experiences intensified productivity due to subsequent nutrient input and significant increase in aquatic microfossils. Our findings pave the way for disentangling climatic and volcanic forcing of natural environmental disturbances.Tephra-induced ecosystem changes at Lake Van, Turkey, are distinct from those of climate change in terms of fire activity, aquatic ecology and ecosystem recovery time, according to a multi-proxy analysis of varve deposits from the period 340,000 to 32,000 years ago

T1  - Decline in seasonal predictability potentially destabilized Classic Maya societies
AN  - 2787782750
AB  - Classic Maya populations living in peri-urban states were highly dependent on seasonally distributed rainfall for reliable surplus crop yields. Despite intense study of the potential impact of decadal to centennial-scale climatic changes on the demise of Classic Maya sociopolitical institutions (750-950 CE), its direct importance remains debated. We provide a detailed analysis of a precisely dated speleothem record from Yok Balum cave, Belize, that reflects local hydroclimatic changes at seasonal scale over the past 1600 years. We find that the initial disintegration of Maya sociopolitical institutions and population decline occurred in the context of a pronounced decrease in the predictability of seasonal rainfall and severe drought between 700 and 800 CE. The failure of Classic Maya societies to successfully adapt to volatile seasonal rainfall dynamics likely contributed to gradual but widespread processes of sociopolitical disintegration. We propose that the complex abandonment of Classic Maya population centres was not solely driven by protracted drought but also aggravated by year-to-year decreases in rainfall predictability, potentially caused by a regional reduction in coherent Intertropical Convergence Zone-driven rainfall.The disintegration of complex Classic Maya population centres may have been driven by a decline in seasonal rainfall predictability in addition to protracted drought, suggests a dated speleothem record from Yok Balum cave, Belize.

T1  - Quality of urban climate adaptation plans over time
AN  - 2782080783
AB  - Defining and measuring progress in adaptation are important questions for climate adaptation science, policy, and practice. Here, we assess the progress of urban adaptation planning in 327 European cities between 2005 and 2020 using three ‘ADAptation plan Quality Assessment’ indices, called ADAQA-1/ 2/ 3, that combine six plan quality principles. Half of the cities have an adaptation plan and its quality significantly increased over time. However, generally, plan quality is still low in many cities. Participation and monitoring and evaluation are particularly weak aspects in urban adaptation policy, together with plan ‘consistency’. Consistency connects impacts and vulnerabilities with adaptation goals, planned measures, actions, monitoring and evaluation, and participation processes. Consistency is a key factor in the overall quality of plans. To help evaluate the quality of plans and policies and promote learning, we suggest incorporating our ADAptation plan Quality Assessment indices into the portfolio of adaptation progress assessments and tracking methodologies.

T1  - Large-scale dynamics moderate impact-relevant changes to organised convective storms
AN  - 2761013470
AB  - Larger organised convective storms (mesoscale-convective systems) can lead to major flood events in Europe. Here we assess end-of-century changes to their characteristics in two convection-permitting climate simulations from the UK Met Office and ETH-Zürich that both use the high Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario but different approaches to represent atmospheric changes with global warming and different models. The UK Met Office projections indicate more frequent, smaller, and slower-moving storms, while ETH-Zürich projections show fewer, larger, and faster-moving storms. However, both simulations show increases to peak precipitation intensity, total precipitation volume, and temporal clustering, suggesting increasing risks from mesoscale-convective systems in the future. Importantly, the largest storms that pose increased flood risks are projected to increase in frequency and intensity. These results highlight that understanding large-scale dynamical drivers as well as the thermodynamical response of storms is essential for accurate projections of changes to storm hazards, needed for future climate adaptation.Two convection-permitting climate models project similar increases in peak rainfall intensities from mesoscale convective storms across Europe by 2100, but project contrasting changes to storm frequency, size, and speed due to differences in the representation of dynamical responses to global warming.

T1  - Roadmap on energy harvesting materials
AN  - 2847465640
AB  - Ambient energy harvesting has great potential to contribute to sustainable development and address growing environmental challenges. Converting waste energy from energy-intensive processes and systems (e.g. combustion engines and furnaces) is crucial to reducing their environmental impact and achieving net-zero emissions. Compact energy harvesters will also be key to powering the exponentially growing smart devices ecosystem that is part of the Internet of Things, thus enabling futuristic applications that can improve our quality of life (e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart manufacturing, and smart healthcare). To achieve these goals, innovative materials are needed to efficiently convert ambient energy into electricity through various physical mechanisms, such as the photovoltaic effect, thermoelectricity, piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, and radiofrequency wireless power transfer. By bringing together the perspectives of experts in various types of energy harvesting materials, this Roadmap provides extensive insights into recent advances and present challenges in the field. Additionally, the Roadmap analyses the key performance metrics of these technologies in relation to their ultimate energy conversion limits. Building on these insights, the Roadmap outlines promising directions for future research to fully harness the potential of energy harvesting materials for green energy anytime, anywhere.

T1  - Direct measurement of warm Atlantic Intermediate Water close to the grounding line of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79∘ N) Glacier, northeast Greenland
AN  - 2809338187
AB  - The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream has recently seen significant change to its floating margins and has been identified as vulnerable to future climate warming. Inflow of warm Atlantic Intermediate Water (AIW) from the continental shelf has been observed in the vicinity of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79∘ N) Glacier calving front, but AIW penetration deep into the ice shelf cavity has not been observed directly. Here, we report temperature and salinity measurements from profiles in an epishelf lake, which provide the first direct evidence of AIW proximal to the grounding line of 79∘ N Glacier, over 50 km from the calving front. We also report evidence for partial un-grounding of the margin of 79∘ N Glacier taking place at the western end of the epishelf lake. Comparison of our measurements to those close to the calving front shows that AIW transits the cavity to reach the grounding line within a few months. The observations provide support for modelling studies that infer AIW-driven basal melt proximal to the grounding line and demonstrate that offshore oceanographic changes can be rapidly transmitted throughout the sub-ice-shelf cavity, with implications for near-future stability of the ice stream.

T1  - Higher Temperatures in Socially Vulnerable US Communities Increasingly Limit Safe Use of Electric Fans for Cooling
AN  - 2857892467
AB  - As the globe warms, people will increasingly need affordable, safe methods to stay cool and minimize the worst health impacts of heat exposure. One of the cheapest cooling methods is electric fans. Recent research has recommended ambient air temperature thresholds for safe fan use in adults. Here we use hourly weather reanalysis data (1950–2021) to examine the temporal and spatial evolution of ambient climate conditions in the continental United States (CONUS) considered safe for fan use, focusing on high social vulnerability index (SVI) regions. We find that although most hours in the day are safe for fan use, there are regions that experience hundreds to thousands of hours per year that are too hot for safe fan use. Over the last several decades, the number of hours considered unsafe for fan use has increased across most of the CONUS (on average by ∼70%), with hotspots across the US West and South, suggesting that many individuals will increasingly need alternative cooling strategies. People living in high-SVI locations are 1.5–2 times more likely to experience hotter climate conditions than the overall US population. High-SVI locations also experience higher rates of warming that are approaching and exceeding important safety thresholds that relate to climate adaptation. These results highlight the need to direct additional resources to these communities for heat adaptive strategies.

T1  - Evaluating net life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions intensities from gas and coal at varying methane leakage rates
AN  - 2838750344
AB  - The net climate impact of gas and coal life-cycle emissions are highly dependent on methane leakage. Every molecule of methane leaked alters the climate advantage because methane warms the planet significantly more than CO2 over its decade-long lifetime. We find that global gas systems that leak over 4.7% of their methane (when considering a 20-year timeframe) or 7.6% (when considering a 100 year timeframe) are on par with life-cycle coal emissions from methane leaking coal mines. The net climate impact from coal is also influenced by SO2 emissions, which react to form sulfate aerosols that mask warming. We run scenarios that combine varying methane leakage rates from coal and gas with low to high SO2 emissions based on coal sulfur content, flue gas scrubber efficiency, and sulfate aerosol global warming potentials. The methane and SO2 co-emitted with CO2 alter the emissions parity between gas and coal. We estimate that a gas system leakage rate as low as 0.2% is on par with coal, assuming 1.5% sulfur coal that is scrubbed at a 90% efficiency with no coal mine methane when considering climate effects over a 20 year timeframe. Recent aerial measurement surveys of US oil and gas production basins find wide-ranging natural gas leak rates 0.65% to 66.2%, with similar leakage rates detected worldwide. These numerous super-emitting gas systems being detected globally underscore the need to accelerate methane emissions detection, accounting, and management practices to certify that gas assets are less emissions intensive than coal.

T1  - Assessing the environmental impacts of renewable energy sources: A case study on air pollution and carbon emissions in China.
AN  - 2835269548; 37421726
AB  - This study investigates the impact of renewable and non-renewable energy sources on carbon emissions in the context of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The plan emphasises a "Dual-control" strategy of simultaneously setting energy consumption limits and reducing energy intensity for GDP (gross domestic product) in order to meet the targets of the five-year plan. Using a comprehensive dataset of Chinese energy and macroeconomic information spanning from 1990 to 2022, we conduct a Granger causality analysis to explore the relationship between energy sources and the level of air pollution. Our findings reveal a unidirectional link, wherein renewable energy contributes to a reduction in air pollution, while non-renewable energy sources lead to an increase. Despite the government's investment in renewable energy, our results show that China's economy remains heavily reliant on traditional energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels). This research is the first systematic examination of the interplay between energy usage and carbon emissions in the Chinese context. Our findings provide valuable insights for policy and market strategies aimed at promoting carbon neutrality and driving technological advancements in both government and industries.

T1  - A systematic comparison of deforestation drivers and policy effectiveness across the Amazon biome
AN  - 2826813944
AB  - The Amazon biome, spanning nine countries, has one of the highest rates of deforestation worldwide. This deforestation contributes to biodiversity loss, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, and damage to rural and indigenous livelihoods. Hundreds of articles have been published on the topic of deforestation across Amazonia, yet there has been no recent synthesis of deforestation drivers and deforestation-control policy effectiveness in the region. Here we undertook the first systematic review of papers published between 2000 and 2021 that have causally linked proximate and underlying drivers and policies to deforestation outcomes in Amazonia. In the 155 articles that met our inclusion criteria, we find that causal research is concentrated in Brazil, and to a lesser degree Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. There has been little study of the Guianas, Venezuela or Colombia. Large- and small-scale agriculture linked to improved market access and high agricultural prices are frequently researched underlying drivers of deforestation across the heavily researched regions. In the Guianas research focuses on mining with little focus on underlying causes. Research on infrastructure expansion, mining, and oil extraction and on technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors remains sparse. Many public and private policies have been found to be effective in controlling deforestation across the biome, with protected areas and public policies standing out as particularly successful in slowing deforestation vis-à-vis supply chain approaches. Frontier age, land tenure, and policy interactions are key moderating factors affecting the outcomes of different underlying causes and policies. Our findings indicate a greater need for research on (i) additional deforestation drivers beyond agriculture and economic factors, (ii) the complex interactions between different drivers and deforestation control policies, (iii) causes underlying deforestation in low or new deforestation areas, and (iv) the dynamics between Amazonian subregions and countries. Understanding the extent and diversity of deforestation drivers and effectiveness of existing deforestation mitigation policies across Amazonia is a necessary first step toward designing policies to further reduce deforestation in the biome.

T1  - Re-evaluating the impacts of green innovations and renewable energy on carbon neutrality: Does social inclusiveness really matters?
AN  - 2791380281; 36924712
AB  - This study explores the impact of green innovation and renewable energy on carbon emissions, considering the mediating role of social inclusivity for a panel of 24 countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 1994 to 2019. The empirical strategy is framed in a generalized method of moments dynamic panel, which is novel for assessing the short- and long-term relationships among the variables. By controlling for confounders, we assessed the mechanism by which green innovation and renewable energy contribute to carbon emissions. Furthermore, for consistency with prior empirical research, we extended the analysis using alternative statistical specification by Hausman-Taylor and the feasible generalized least squares, which controls for potential endogeneity issues and cross-panel correlation. Our results are relatively mixed: our analysis suggests that green innovation and economic growth are positive and statistically significant predictors of carbon emissions. However, renewable energy and social inclusiveness were both negative and significant predictors of carbon emissions. These results suggest that renewable energy and social inclusiveness can serve as remedies for promoting environmental quality and reducing carbon emissions in OECD countries. Therefore, we recommend promoting the expansion of renewable energy at a lower cost to unserved and underserved communities and promoting social inclusiveness to achieve a net zero emission target.

T1  - The Contribution of Microrefugia to Landscape Thermal Inertia for Climate-Adaptive Conservation Strategies
AN  - 2830309076
AB  - Current temperatures in microrefugia may persist longer than in nearby areas as temperatures warm. However, locating and measuring the contribution of microrefugia to thermal inertia in a landscape is challenging. We measured the thermal buffering capacity of microrefugia across a 40,000 km2 region of complex mountain topography by quantifying environmental lapse rate and solar radiation effects on air temperature in 0.1 km2 hexagons, a resource management-relevant scale for climate adaptation. The greatest buffering capacity is −1.62°C, and only 2.8% of the region can buffer 1°C or greater. Historical loss of local cooling capacity is low, but by 2069 only 6.9%–11% of the region retains baseline temperature conditions. This thermal buffer index can find the most climate change-buffered areas in lands identified as high priority for habitat conservation, wildlife corridors, and forest preservation. Other processes such as cold air pooling can complement our approach but depend on additional factors.

T1  - Severe wildfires promoted by climate change negatively impact forest amphibian metacommunities
AN  - 2814614191
AB  - AimChanges to the extent and severity of wildfires driven by anthropogenic climate change are predicted to have compounding negative consequences for ecological communities. While there is evidence that severe weather events like drought impact amphibian communities, the effects of wildfire on such communities are not well understood. The impact of wildfire on amphibian communities and species is likely to vary, owing to the diversity of their life-history traits. However, no previous research has identified commonalities among the amphibians at most risk from wildfire, limiting conservation initiatives in the aftermath of severe wildfire. We aimed to investigate the impacts of the unprecedented 2019–2020 black summer bushfires on Australian forest amphibian communities.LocationEastern coast of New South Wales, Australia.MethodsWe conducted visual encounter surveys and passive acoustic monitoring across 411 sites within two regions, one in northeast and one in southeast New South Wales. We used fire severity and extent mapping in two multispecies occupancy models to assess the impacts of fire on 35 forest amphibian species.ResultsWe demonstrate a negative influence of severe fire extent on metacommunity occupancy and species richness in the south with weaker effects in the north—reflective of the less severe fires that occurred in this region. Both threatened and common species were impacted by severe wildfire extent. Occupancy of burrowing species and rain forest specialists had mostly negative relationships with severe wildfire extent, while arboreal amphibians had neutral relationships.Main ConclusionMetacommunity monitoring and adaptive conservation strategies are needed to account for common species after severe climatic events. Ecological, morphological and life-history variation drives the susceptibility of amphibians to wildfires. We document the first evidence of climate change-driven wildfires impacting temperate forest amphibian communities across a broad geographic area, which raises serious concern for the persistence of amphibians under an increasingly fire-prone climate.

T1  - Towards more inclusive and solution orientated community-based environmental monitoring
AN  - 2813003390
AB  - Rapid climate-driven environmental change continues to threaten front-line communities that rely on Arctic landscapes to sustain their way of life. Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) can increase our knowledge of environmental change and understanding of human-environment interactions occurring across the Arctic. However, the depth of CBM research outcomes have been limited by an imbalance in contributions from external researchers and community members. A detailed literature analysis revealed that the number of studies documenting CBM approaches in Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homeland in Canada) have increased over the last decade. We identify that bottom-up guiding protocols including the National Inuit Strategy on Research, has increased community engagement in Arctic research processes and equitable outcomes. However, these increases have been concentrated on wildlife-based research where consistent funding streams and pre-existing alignment with community priorities exist. To explore the potential for guiding principles to be more successfully incorporated into impactful CBM, we present a co-developed environmental CBM case study aiming to document and aid understanding of climate-driven landscape change near Tuktoyaktuk, Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Canada since 2018. A foundation of early dialogue and collaborative partnerships between community members and external researchers formed the basis of a community-based climate monitoring program driven by community research priorities. A succession of funded CBM projects at Tuktoyaktuk demonstrated that longer term and resilient climate monitoring can bring together Scientific and Indigenous knowledge systems. Progressing beyond an emphasis on data collection is vital to sustain monitoring efforts, capacity sharing and co-dissemination processes to ensure research is communicated back in a way that is understandable, relevant, and usable to address community priorities. The need for successful CBM is often at odds with current research funding structures, which risks a fragmented mosaic of early-stage initiatives focused on understanding environmental problems rather than sustained and progressive research development towards cooperative solutions.

T1  - Assessing Forest Carbon Accumulation Potential Across Different Treatments using Field Inventory Data
AN  - 2815467550
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation lead to an increase in the level of carbon in the atmosphere and disrupted the global carbon cycle. The tropical forest has received a lot of interest since it contributes around 60% of the total global forest carbon. By enhancing carbon sink, tropical forests have a great potential in mitigating climate change. Assessing aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock through field inventories is crucial for this purpose as it provides the most accurate result. The research was conducted at Danum Valley Conservation Area and INFAPRO in Sabah, Malaysia. An earlier study over 35 years ago at this site suggests that restored forests accrue AGB at twice the rate of regenerating forests, though the cause of this difference between treatments is unclear. Thus, this study will focus on three principal study sites which are restored, naturally regenerating and old-growth forests to determine the forest’s potential to sequester and store carbon in the forest ecosystem. These three sites were chosen because it is a well-established plot from the earlier inventory over the last seven years. The field measuring method is a non-destructive methodology. Tree parameters such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height and tree species diversity were collected for calculating AGB using a species-specific allometric equation. Results showed a positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock across three different forest treatments. The active restoration increases up to 151% carbon stock whilst the old-growth forest increased by 34% and natural regeneration increased by 73%, which active restoration can be the best solution for forest treatment. The outcome of this study will increase the ability of forest authorities and the Malaysian government to effective monitoring of carbon stock for establishing reliable standard guidelines in measuring deforestation and forest degradation toward achieving sustainable forest management.

T1  - Holocene history of the 79∘ N ice shelf reconstructed from epishelf lake and uplifted glaciomarine sediments
AN  - 2786747783
AB  - Nioghalvfjerdsbrae, or 79∘ N Glacier, is the largest marine-terminating glacier draining the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS). In recent years, its ∼ 70 km long fringing ice shelf (hereafter referred to as the 79∘ N ice shelf) has thinned, and a number of small calving events highlight its sensitivity to climate warming. With the continued retreat of the 79∘ N ice shelf and the potential for accelerated discharge from NEGIS, which drains 16 % of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), it has become increasingly important to understand the long-term history of the ice shelf in order to put the recent changes into perspective and to judge their long-term significance. Here, we reconstruct the Holocene dynamics of the 79∘ N ice shelf by combining radiocarbon dating of marine molluscs from isostatically uplifted glaciomarine sediments with a multi-proxy investigation of two sediment cores recovered from Blåsø, a large epishelf lake 2–13 km from the current grounding line of 79∘ N Glacier. Our reconstructions suggest that the ice shelf retreated between 8.5 and 4.4 kacalBP, which is consistent with previous work charting grounding line and ice shelf retreat to the coast as well as open marine conditions in Nioghalvfjerdsbrae. Ice shelf retreat followed a period of enhanced atmospheric and ocean warming in the Early Holocene. Based on our detailed sedimentological, microfaunal, and biomarker evidence, the ice shelf reformed at Blåsø after 4.4 kacalBP, reaching a thickness similar to present by 4.0 kacalBP. Reformation of the ice shelf coincides with decreasing atmospheric temperatures, the increased dominance of Polar Water, a reduction in Atlantic Water, and (near-)perennial sea-ice cover on the adjacent continental shelf. Along with available climate archives, our data indicate that the 79∘ N ice shelf is susceptible to collapse at mean atmospheric and ocean temperatures ∼ 2 ∘C warmer than present, which could be achieved by the middle of this century under some emission scenarios. Finally, the presence of “marine” markers in the uppermost part of the Blåsø sediment cores could record modern ice shelf thinning, although the significance and precise timing of these changes requires further work.

T1  - Thinning and surface mass balance patterns of two neighbouring debris-covered glaciers in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
AN  - 2863703845
AB  - Debris-covered glaciers are a common feature of the mountain cryosphere in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. A better understanding of these glaciers is necessary to reduce the uncertainties in regional water resource variability and to anticipate potential cryospheric risks. In this study, we quantified the seasonal thinning and surface mass balance patterns of two neighbouring debris-covered glaciers (23K Glacier and 24K Glacier) in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau with four unpiloted aerial vehicle surveys and in situ measurements. We observed that the thinning of 23K Glacier was ∼2–7 times greater than that of the 24K Glacier for annual and cold periods. The surface velocity of the 24K Glacier is higher than that of the 23K Glacier (∼5–6 times) for all periods. In contrast with the thinning patterns, the surface mass balance patterns of the two glaciers closely agree across the different periods. We found that the surface mass balance distribution strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of debris thickness for both glaciers. Ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds are prevalent on the surface of these glaciers (∼4.4–7.2±0.5 %) and enhance melt overall (enhancement factor: ∼2.5) but do not control the surface mass balance pattern of either glacier. This comparison study of two neighbouring glaciers confirms the significance of both glacier dynamics and debris thickness in controlling thinning and melt for the different debris-covered glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau in the context of climate change.

T1  - Emergent increase in coral thermal tolerance reduces mass bleaching under climate change
AN  - 2854685609
AB  - Recurrent mass bleaching events threaten the future of coral reefs. To persist under climate change, corals will need to endure progressively more intense and frequent marine heatwaves, yet it remains unknown whether their thermal tolerance can keep pace with warming. Here, we reveal an emergent increase in the thermal tolerance of coral assemblages at a rate of 0.1 °C/decade for a remote Pacific coral reef system. This led to less severe bleaching impacts than would have been predicted otherwise, indicating adaptation, acclimatisation or shifts in community structure. Using future climate projections, we show that if thermal tolerance continues to rise over the coming century at the most-likely historic rate, substantial reductions in bleaching trajectories are possible. High-frequency bleaching can be fully mitigated at some reefs under low-to-middle emissions scenarios, yet can only be delayed under high emissions scenarios. Collectively, our results indicate a potential ecological resilience to climate change, but still highlight the need for reducing carbon emissions in line with Paris Agreement commitments to preserve coral reefs.Marine heatwaves and mass bleaching mortality events threaten the persistence of coral communities on tropical reefs. This study demonstrates that the thermal tolerance of coral communities in Palau has likely increased since the late 1980s. Such ecological resilience could reduce future bleaching impacts if global carbon emissions are cut down.

T1  - Reimagining the Role of Health Departments and Their Partners in Addressing Climate Change: Revising the Building Resilience against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework
AN  - 2849010159
AB  - Public health departments have important roles to play in addressing the local health impacts of climate change, yet are often not well prepared to do so. The Climate and Health Program (CHP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework in 2012 as a five-step planning framework to support public health departments and their partners to respond to the health impacts of climate change. CHP has initiated a process to revise the framework to address learnings from a decade of experience with BRACE and advances in the science and practice of addressing climate and health. The aim of this manuscript is to describe the methodology for revising the BRACE framework and the expected outputs of this process. Development of the revised framework and associated guidance and tools will be guided by a multi-sector expert panel, and finalization will be informed by usability testing. Planned revisions to BRACE will (1) be consistent with the vision of Public Health 3.0 and position health departments as “chief health strategists” in their communities, who are responsible for facilitating the establishment and maintenance of cross-sector collaborations with community organizations, other partners, and other government agencies to address local climate impacts and prevent further harm to historically underserved communities; (2) place health equity as a central, guiding tenet; (3) incorporate greenhouse gas mitigation strategies, in addition to its previous focus on climate adaptation; and (4) feature a new set of tools to support BRACE implementation among a diverse set of users. The revised BRACE framework and the associated tools will support public health departments and their partners as they strive to prevent and reduce the negative health impacts of climate change for everyone, while focusing on improving health equity.

T1  - Development of a Google Earth Engine-Based Application for the Management of Shallow Coral Reefs Using Drone Imagery
AN  - 2843103260
AB  - The Caribbean is one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to the projected impacts of climate change, and changes in coral reef ecosystems have been studied over the last two decades. Lately, new technology-based methods using satellites and unmanned vehicles, among others have emerged as tools to aid the governance of these ecosystems by providing managers with high-quality data for decision-making processes. This paper addresses the development of a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based application for use in the management processes of shallow coral reef ecosystems, using images acquired with Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) known as drones, at the Old Providence McBean Lagoon National Natural Park; a Marine Protected Area (MPA) located northwest of Old Providence Island, Colombia. Image acquisition and processing, known as drone imagery, is first described for flights performed using an RTK multispectral drone at five different monitoring stations within the MPA. Then, the use of the GEE app is described and illustrated. The user executes four simple steps starting with the selection of the orthomosaics uploaded to GEE and obtaining the reef habitat classification for four categories: coral, macroalgae, sand, and rubble, at any of the five monitoring stations. Results show that these classes can be effectively mapped using different machine-learning (ML) algorithms available inside GEE, helping the manager obtain high-quality information about the reef. This remote-sensing application represents an easy-to-use tool for managers that can be integrated into modern ecosystem monitoring protocols, supporting effective reef governance within a digitized society with more demanding stakeholders.

T1  - Amplified surface warming in the south-west Pacific during the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma) and future implications
AN  - 2836165459
AB  - Based on Nationally Determined Contributions concurrent with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 2-4.5, the IPCC predicts global warming of 2.1–3.5 ∘C (very likely range 10–90th percentile) by 2100 CE. However, global average temperature is a poor indicator of regional warming and global climate models (GCMs) require validation with instrumental or proxy data from geological archives to assess their ability to simulate regional ocean and atmospheric circulation, and thus, to evaluate their performance for regional climate projections. The south-west Pacific is a region that performs poorly when GCMs are evaluated against instrumental observations. The New Zealand Earth System Model (NZESM) was developed from the United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) to better understand south-west Pacific response to global change, by including a nested ocean grid in the south-west Pacific with 80 % greater horizontal resolution than the global-scale host.Here, we reconstruct regional south-west Pacific sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) for the mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP; 3.3–3.0 Ma), which has been widely considered a past analogue with an equilibrium surface temperature response of +3 ∘C to an atmospheric CO2 concentration of∼350–400 ppm, in order to assess the warming distribution in the south-west Pacific. This study presents proxy SSTs from seven deep sea sediment cores distributed across the south-west Pacific. Our reconstructed SSTs are derived from molecular biomarkers preserved in the sediment – alkenones (i.e. U37K′ index) and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (i.e. TEX86 index) – and are compared with SSTs reconstructed from the Last Interglacial (125 ka), Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) outputs and transient climate model projections (NZESM and UKESM) of low- to high-range SSPs for 2090–2099 CE.Mean interglacial equilibrium SSTs during the mPWP for the south-west Pacific sites were on average 4.2 ∘C (1.8–6.1 ∘C likely range) above pre-industrial temperatures and show good agreement with model outputs from NZESM and UKESM under mid-range SSP 2–4.6 conditions. These results highlight that not only is the mPWP an appropriate analogue when considering future temperature change in the centuries to come, but they also demonstrate that the south-west Pacific region will experience warming that exceeds that of the global mean if atmospheric CO2 remains above 350 ppm.

T1  - Experiences from a School–University Partnership Climate and Sustainability Education Project in England: The Value of Citizen Science and Practical STEM Approaches
AN  - 2829881566
AB  - Extracurricular citizen science and hands-on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths) projects can ensure that climate and sustainability education is not just superficial but truly transformative. Through working under the guidance of academic partners, young people can develop a deep appreciation for climate science and, most importantly, become aware of the real-world sustainable solutions being developed to address the consequences of our changing climate. We present the experiences of four stakeholders from one case study involving middle school students (9–13 years) and their teachers working on a climate change and sustainable drainage system (SuDS) project with academics from Newcastle University and the Schools Engagement programme of the Royal Society. We found that all stakeholders considered it to be a successful project with significant benefits, including engaging learning in the pupils, a challenge for the teachers, and meaningful data collection for the academic team. The funding organisation thought the positive interactions that they try to encourage between students and STEM partners were evidenced in this project perfectly. Young people are future decision makers; this type of project can enable them to develop essential skills and an understanding of a range of STEM careers. Subsequent developments may include refining the way similar projects are run.

T1  - A Multidirectional Forearm Electromagnetic Generator Designed via Numerical Simulations
AN  - 2829690614
AB  - Harvesting biomechanical energy from daily human body motions provides a promising and sustainable power solution for wearable electronics, whose current power supplies, i.e., batteries, have unsatisfactory capacity and durability due to volume, shape, and flexibility constraints. Electromagnetic generators (EMGs) are favorable energy transducers because of their high energy-conversion efficiency, low dependence on frequencies, and long-term stability. However, an EMG that can effectively harvest energy from multi-directional arm motions at aperiodic low frequencies are yet to be created. Here, we introduce a unique EMG configuration by combining a linear and a helix frame into a monolithic unit (EMG-LH), enabling the EMG to scavenge energy from all kinds of arm motions up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs) (movement along XYZ axes and forearm rotations). The EMG frame geometry is designed and optimized according to numerical simulations. To clarify the working mechanism and maximize the power output, the copper coils’ winding pattern, the magnets’ velocity profiles, and the resulting voltage output are numerically simulated and then experimentally verified. Our EMG-LH outperforms linear EMGs (EMG-Ls) and helix EMGs (EMG-Hs) in harvesting energy from all arm motions. This work explicitly presents a forearm-wearable energy harvester as a sustainable power source for wearable electronics.

T1  - Critical role of biomass burning aerosols in enhanced historical Indian Ocean warming
AN  - 2825643499
AB  - The tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) has experienced enhanced surface warming relative to the tropical mean during the past century, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use single-forcing, large-ensemble coupled model simulations to demonstrate that changes of biomass burning (BMB) aerosols have played a critical role in this TIO relative warming. Although the BMB aerosol changes have little effect on global mean temperatures due to regional cancellation, they significantly influence the pattern of warming over the tropical oceans. The reduction of BMB aerosols over the Indian subcontinent induces a TIO warming, while the increase of BMB aerosols over South America and Africa causes a cooling of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. The resultant TIO relative warming leads to prominent global climate changes, including a westward expanded Indo-Pacific warm pool, a fresher TIO due to enhanced rainfall, and an intensified North Atlantic jet stream affecting European hydroclimate.The Indian Ocean has experienced enhanced surface warming in the past century, causing global climatic impacts. In this study, we identified the changes in biomass burning induced aerosols as a critical driver for the enhanced Indian Ocean warming.

T1  - Multi-Stage Bargaining of Smart Grid Energy Trading Based on Cooperative Game Theory
AN  - 2823997383
AB  - Due to global warming and climate change, it is essential to produce power using renewable sources, such as solar, wind, fuel cells, etc. The traditional grid shifts towards the smart grid by infusing digital communication techniques and information technology. As the current power system is shifting towards a smart grid, the utility and prosumers participate in the energy trading process. Due to the distributed nature of the smart grid, providing a fair price among them is becoming a difficult task. The article introduces a model for energy trading in a smart grid by allowing participants to negotiate in multiple stages using a game-theory-based multi-stage Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS). The model’s application of game theory enables the participants to decide on a mutually acceptable price, thereby encouraging the utility, private parties and prosumers (those who are able to generate and consume energy) to participate in the trading process. Since all parties participate in the trading procedure, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The proposed model also balances the benefits of consumers and producers in the final agreed fixed price. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed work, we compare the analytical results with feed-in-tariff (FiT) techniques in terms of consumers’ energy bills and producers’ revenue. For experimental analysis, 20 participants are considered, where the percentage reduction in the bill of each consumer and the percentage increment of revenue of each producer are compared to FiT. On average, the overall bill of the consumer is reduced by 32.8%, and the producers’ revenue is increased by 64.83% compared to FiT. It has been shown further that the proposed model shows better performance as compared to FiT with an increase in the number of participants. The analysis of carbon emission reduction in the proposed model has been analyzed, where, for 10 participants, the carbon emission reduction is approximately 28.48 kg/kWh, and for 100 participants is 342.397 kg/kWh.

T1  - The important role of African emissions reductions in projected local rainfall changes
AN  - 2819770794
AB  - Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change but emits a small portion of global greenhouse gases. Additionally, decarbonization might lead to a ‘climate penalty’ whereby reductions in cooling aerosols offset temperature benefits from CO2 reductions for several decades. However, climate change impacts conditions other than temperatures, including precipitation. Using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies climate model, we find that although African emissions cuts have weak impacts on projected African temperatures, they significantly impact rainfall. Whereas business-as-usual increasing emissions lead to substantial drying over tropical Northern Hemisphere Africa during local summer, that drying is essentially eliminated under a sustainable development pathway. The reduction in cooling aerosols is responsible for ~33–90% of the avoided drying in our model, with the remainder largely attributable to reduced absorbing aerosols. African policy choices may therefore greatly reduce regional African summer drying, giving parts of Africa substantial leverage over their own climate and air quality future.

T1  - Energy and Exergy Analyses of a PWR-Type Nuclear Power Plant Coupled with an ME-TVC-MED Desalination System
AN  - 2819496103
AB  - Electricity–water cogeneration power plants are an important tool for advancing sustainable water treatment technologies because they provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for meeting the energy and water needs of communities. By integrating power and water production, these technologies can reduce carbon emissions and help mitigate the impact of climate change. This work deals with the energy and exergy analysis of a cogeneration plant for electrical power generation and water desalination using real operational data. The power side is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power plant (NPP), while the desalination side is a multi-effect distillation (MED) system with a thermo-vapor compressor (TVC) plant coupled with a conventional multi-effect plant (ME-TVC-MED). A mathematical model was implemented in MATLAB software and validated through a comparison with previously published research. The exergy analysis was carried out based on the second law of thermodynamics to evaluate the irreversibility of the plant and the subsystems. In this study, the components of the sub-systems were analyzed separately to identify and quantify the component that has a high loss of energy and exergy. According to the energy and exergy analyses, the highest source of irreversibility occurs in the reactor core with 50% of the total exergy destruction. However, turbines, steam generators, and condensers also contribute to energy loss. Further, the thermodynamic efficiency of the cogeneration plant was obtained as 35.38%, which is more effective than other systems. In the ME-TVC-MED desalination unit, the main sources of energy losses are located in the evaporators and the thermo-compressor (about 50% and 36%, respectively). Moreover, the exergetic efficiency of the ME-TVC-MED unit was found to be low at 6.43%, indicating a high degree of technical inefficiency in the desalination process. Therefore, many opportunities exist to improve the performance of the cogeneration system.

T1  - A New Decision Framework for Hybrid Solar and Wind Power Plant Site Selection Using Linear Regression Modeling Based on GIS-AHP
AN  - 2819493241
AB  - Currently, worldwide attention to clean energy and sustainable energy has been expedited because of its many environmental benefits. In fact, wind and solar energies play a prime role in decarbonizing the energy market. However, finding the most suitable locations for wind/solar power plants is difficult because of the non-homogeneous distribution of these sources. This paper presents a novel method for selecting the optimal locations for wind and solar farms by mapping the space of the decision criteria to the site score. In addition, the multiple linear regression model was used, with the help of the combination of GIS and AHP methods, to model the siting of wind and solar power plants. The site scoring method used in this study is reliable and globally evaluated; therefore, the scores are accurate and effective. To reveal the ability of the proposed method, two study areas were investigated and researched. The results achieved based on the introduced method showed that, in case study 1, areas with an area of about 9, 4 and 7 km2 are suitable for the construction of wind, solar and wind/solar power plants, respectively. This paper also used fourteen existing wind/solar, wind and solar farms from five continents around the world. The results showed that the suggested model acts the same as the real data. In addition to the interest these results hold for the development of renewable energy in the study area, this novel approach may be applied elsewhere to select optimum sites for wind, solar, and combined wind and solar farms.

T1  - The Evolution of Historic Agroforestry Landscape in the Northern Apennines (Italy) and Its Consequences for Slope Geomorphic Processes
AN  - 2819443182
AB  - Historic agricultural practices have played a dominant role in shaping landscapes, creating a heritage which must be understood and conserved from the perspective of sustainable development. Agroforestry (i.e., the practice of combining trees with agriculture or livestock) has existed since ancient times in European countries, and it has been recognised as one of the most resilient and multifunctional cultural landscapes, providing a wide range of economic, sociocultural, and environmental benefits. This research explores aspects of the history, physical characteristics, decline, and current state of conservation of historic agroforestry systems on the Northern Apennines in Italy, using an interdisciplinary approach combining archival sources, landscape archaeology, dendrochronology, and GIS analysis. Furthermore, through computer-based modelling, this research aims to evaluate how the abandonment of this historic rural land-use strategy impacted slope geomorphic processes over the long term. The importance of environmental values attached to traditional rural landscapes has received much attention even beyond the heritage sector, justifying the definition of transdisciplinary approaches necessary to ensure the holistic management of landscapes. Through the integration of the Unit Stream Power-Based Erosion Deposition (USPED) equation with landscape archaeological data, the paper shows how restoring the historic agroforestry landscape could significantly mitigate soil mass movements in the area. Thus, the interdisciplinary workflow proposed in this study enables a deep understanding of both the historical evolution of agroforestry systems and its resulting effects for cumulative soil erosion and deposition in the face of climate change.

T1  - Prescribed Fire in UK Heather-Dominated Blanket Bog Peatlands: A Critical Review of “Carbon Storage and Sequestration by Habitat: A Review of the Evidence (Second Edition)” by Gregg et al., 2021
AN  - 2819443138
AB  - Peatlands are a vast global carbon store. Both climate change and management have shaped peatlands over millennia, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively. Across the globe, prescribed fire is an important and well-recognised vegetation management tool used to promote biodiversity, increase habitat heterogeneity and mitigate uncontrolled wildfires. However, in the UK, there is an ongoing debate about the efficacy and legitimacy of using prescribed fire as a vegetation management tool. The debate centres around the extent to which prescribed burning is associated with a decline in habitat status and ecological function, especially in relation to carbon storage within heather-dominated blanket bog peatlands. Robust reviews of the evidence base are thus required to disentangle this debate and inform land management policies that ensure the protection and enhancement of blanket bog ecological functioning. Here, we critically review “Carbon storage and sequestration by habitat: a review of the evidence (second edition)” by Gregg et al., 2021. We see the value in synthesising the evidence on this topic but question the methodological approach used by Gregg et al. Another concern is their misrepresentation of evidence relating to prescribed burning impacts on blanket bog ecosystems and carbon budgets. We highlight these issues by focusing on the relevant peatland sections within the review by Gregg et al. and conclude by making a series of recommendations to improve the review’s scientific robustness and, thereby, its value to academics, land managers and policymakers.

T1  - An Overview of Permanent Grassland Grazing Management Practices and the Impacts on Principal Soil Quality Indicators
AN  - 2819263561
AB  - Grasslands are at risk of degradation due to unsustainable management practices and climate change. Here, we review the principal soil quality indicators (SQIs) to evaluate the sustainability of different grassland management practices globally. We discuss the importance of SQI assessment and the Soil Quality Minimum Dataset (MDS) specifically in the context of grasslands. We then review two potential solutions, the first of which is adopting grazing management, whereby sustainable grazing management plans (GMPs) offer great potential. The other solution is the development and adoption of novel grassland species, which may improve either drought resistance or infiltration rates, erosion and flooding. Sustainable grassland soil management can promote ecosystem service delivery and improve the resilience of the entire grassland ecosystem to anthropogenic change.

T1  - Cavitation Hydrodynamic Performance of 3-D Printed Highly Skewed Stainless Steel Tidal Turbine Rotors
AN  - 2812438911
AB  - Hydraulic turbines contribute to 60% of renewable energy in the world; however, they also entail some adverse effects on the aquatic ecology system. One such effect is their excessive noise and vibration. To minimize this effect, one of the most effective and feasible solutions is to modify the design of the turbine rotor blade by introducing a skew. In this study, two 0.3-meter tidal turbines with 0-degree (no-skewness) and positive 90-degree skewness made of stainless steel 316L were designed and printed using a 3-D printing powder bed fusion technique. These rotors were then tested at the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel (ECT) at Newcastle University, UK, and the variation in the skewness of the blades of the turbines as a function of the power coefficient on a given tip speed ratio (TSR) value was ascertained. Results showed that the highly skewed rotor had significantly lower drag and torque fluctuations, with a slight decrease in efficiency compared to the non-skewed one, which warrants further investigation on the effect of added skew to reduce vibration and noise. Numerical simulations were also performed for verification and validation of the experimental tests, using the H45 dynamometer at the ECT. A comprehensive software code for propellers and tidal turbines, ROTORYSICS, was used to examine the cavitation effect of the two rotors; a comparison was made for both, with and without cavitation. The results indicate that for a high immersion depth of tidal turbine rotors, cavitation rarely occurs, but for hydrokinetic turbines that are installed on dams in rivers and falls, cavitation could be a serious concern. It was concluded that the 0-degree skewed rotor is more hydrodynamically efficient than the 90-degree skewed rotor.

T1  - The Legal, the Digital, and the Global Production of Space
AN  - 2811665899
AB  - The essay stages the law at the intersections between the humanities, technology, and the production of digital space. Interactions like these are relevant in the present age, where humankind is outcompeting natural resources and changing the earth. The Anthropocene is an epoch of environmental crisis; despite this, we turn such a crisis into a process of sublimation servient to the control of the earth. Blurring the divide between the digital and the human is functional to such a process. The strategic use of the law makes climate-change policies compatible with global markets. Assuming that manufacturing digital spaces is useful to this end, the essay focuses on multimedia games. Blending real-word performances with internet- and media-related contents, they are functional to sublimation, convincing us that we can tackle climate change without rearranging our economic paradigms.

T1  - Current vehicle emission standards will not mitigate climate change or improve air quality
AN  - 2807782893
AB  - The vehicle emissions testing programme was conducted by the UK Department of Transport in 2016 in response to emissions tampering exposed in the Volkswagen (VW) emissions scandal. The programme identified large emissions discrepancies between real-world and in-lab testing across a range of Euro 5 and Euro 6 diesel passenger vehicles. The large vehicle test fleet reflects the current challenges faced in controlling vehicle emissions. This paper presents the following findings: NOx emissions are altered due to exhaust gas recirculation mismanagement. A new Real-Life Emissions methodology is introduced to improve upon the current Real Driving Emissions standard. A large and concerning emissions divergence was discovered between the achieved NOx improvement and deterioration of CO2. The findings act as catalysts to improve vehicle emissions testing beyond standards established since the VW scandal, aiding in the development of better climate change mitigation strategies and bring tangible air quality improvements to the environment.

T1  - Combining Fuzzy, Multicriteria and Mapping Techniques to Assess Soil Fertility for Agricultural Development: A Case Study of Firozabad District, Uttar Pradesh, India
AN  - 2806560931
AB  - Soil fertility (SF) assessment is an important strategy for identifying agriculturally productive lands, particularly in areas that are vulnerable to climate change. This research focuses on detecting SF zones in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh, India, for agricultural purposes, so that they can be prioritized for future management using the fuzzy technique in the Arc GIS model-builder. The model computing technique was also deployed to determine the different fertility zones, considering 17 soil parameters. The derived fuzzy technique outperformed the traditional method of dividing the sampling sites into clusters to correlate soil fertility classes with the studied soil samples. The prioritization of the soil factors and a spatial analysis of the fertility areas were carried out using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and GIS tools, respectively. The AHP analysis outcome indicated that hydraulic properties had the highest weighted value, followed by physical and chemical properties, regarding their influence on SF. The spatial distribution map of physico-chemical properties also clearly depicts the standard classification. A fuzzy priority map was implemented based on all the classes parameters to identify the five fertility classes of the soil, namely very high (0.05%); high (16.59%); medium (60.94%); low (22.34%); and very low (0.07% of total area). This study will be of significant value to planners and policymakers in the future planning and development of activities and schemes that aim to solve similar problems across the country.

T1  - Hydrodynamic Effect of Highly Skewed Horizontal-Axis Tidal Turbine (HATT) Rotors
AN  - 2806539946
AB  - While hydro turbines generate over 40% of the world’s total renewable energy, these traditional turbines present a great environmental concern due to the potential of their sharp blades to damage aquatic lives and ecology, along with their harmful noise and vibration during operation. One effective solution to these environmental issues is to substantially increase the skew of these blades, which would result in a much safer blade operation for aquatic animals (such as fish, etc.) and a substantial reduction in noise and vibration. Adding skew to turbine rotors is known to reduce cavitation and noise, and hence, to mitigate the environmental impact on underwater fauna and flora. However, adding skew will compromise the power performance of the turbines. This study aimed to identify the effect of rotor skew on the hydrodynamic power performance of a series of horizontal-axis turbine rotors that were manufactured using 3D printing technology and tested in a towing tank. The diameter of the turbine rotor model was 0.3 m and the skewed angle contained positive and negative angles of 45, 60 and 90 degrees along with a non-skewed rotor. This study was conducted to analyze the hydrodynamics of a turbine rotor with different skew angles and a 0-degree skewed rotor. Various tip speed ratios, ranging from 2.3 to 4.3, were set in accordance with the RPM and the carriage speed. Gain and filter were applied to boost the signal, and post-calibration was conducted. The results show that (1) the non-skewed rotor had the highest power coefficient; (2) the rotor with a skew angle of 45 degrees had the lowest power loss, at 6.97%, compared with the zero-skew rotor blades; (3) while the larger the skew, the more loss in power production efficiency, the rotor with a negative 90-degree skewed angle had the largest power loss, 31.42%. It was then concluded that, based on the results and analysis, (1) to achieve the greatest reduction in noise and vibration, the rotor with a skew angle of 90 degrees would be the best choice, and (2) to mitigate noise/vibration and efficiency due to skew, the rotor with a skewed angle of 45 degrees would be the best design choice.

T1  - Predicting Long-Term Effects of Alternative Management Practices in Conventional and Organic Agricultural Systems on Soil Carbon Stocks Using the DayCent Model
AN  - 2806452671
AB  - Recently, many countries have introduced policies that promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as reducing synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and promoting diversified crop rotation. While such management changes might represent an opportunity for the agricultural sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change through carbon (C) sequestration in soils, there are still uncertainties due to the scarcity of reliable long-term data to prove this assumption. In this study, we applied the DayCent model using empirical data from a farm-scale study and an experimental trial study at Nafferton farm in the UK, to assess the long-term effects of contrasting agricultural systems (conventional vs. organic), grazing regimes (non-grazed vs. grazed), arable systems with ley phases, mineral vs. compost fertility sources and conventional vs. organic crop rotation on soil C stocks (0–0.20 m depth). The simulations showed that grazing and higher ley time proportions can increase soil C stocks for a period of at least 30 years, regardless of the agricultural system used (average increase in rates of 0.25 ± 0.02 Mg ha−1 yr−1). Compost fertiliser promoted soil C accumulation for the same period (average increase in rates of 0.3 Mg ha−1 yr−1), but its magnitude was dependent on the choice of crops in the rotation. However, ley time proportions higher than 40% of the full crop rotation did not improve soil C accumulation further. We conclude that the DayCent model can be used to identify the quantity of and the effective period for which management practices can be used to target mitigation efforts, but the balance between sustainability and productivity aspects warrants further research.

T1  - Poleward migration as global warming’s possible self-regulator to restrain future western North Pacific Tropical Cyclone’s intensification
AN  - 2805295814
AB  - Poleward migration is an interesting phenomenon regarding the shift of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) towards higher latitudes. As climate warms, TCs’ intensification is promoted, and yet over certain oceans, TCs may also migrate poleward into colder waters. To what extent this poleward shift can impact future TC’s intensification is unclear, and a quantitative understanding of these competing processes is lacking. Through investigating one of the most likely TC basins to experience poleward migration, the western North Pacific (WNP), here we explore the issue. Potential Intensity (PI, TC’s intensification upper bound) along TC’s intensification locations (from genesis to the lifetime maximum intensity location) are analysed. We find that poleward migration can partially cancel global warming’s positive impact on future WNP TC’s intensification. With poleward migration, the PI increasing trend slope is gentler. We estimate that poleward migration can reduce the increasing trend slope of the proportion of Category-5 PI by 42% (22%) under a strong (moderate) emission pathway; and 68% (30%) increasing trend slope reduction for the average PI.

T1  - The value of ecosystem services in global marine kelp forests
AN  - 2802687516
AB  - While marine kelp forests have provided valuable ecosystem services for millennia, the global ecological and economic value of those services is largely unresolved. Kelp forests are diminishing in many regions worldwide, and efforts to manage these ecosystems are hindered without accurate estimates of the value of the services that kelp forests provide to human societies. Here, we present a global estimate of the ecological and economic potential of three key ecosystem services - fisheries production, nutrient cycling, and carbon removal provided by six major forest forming kelp genera (Ecklonia, Laminaria, Lessonia, Macrocystis, Nereocystis, and Saccharina). Each of these genera creates a potential value of between $64,400 and $147,100/hectare each year. Collectively, they generate between $465 and $562 billion/year worldwide, with an average of $500 billion. These values are primarily driven by fisheries production (mean $29,900, 904 Kg/Ha/year) and nitrogen removal ($73,800, 657 Kg N/Ha/year), though kelp forests are also estimated to sequester 4.91 megatons of carbon from the atmosphere/year highlighting their potential as blue carbon systems for climate change mitigation. These findings highlight the ecological and economic value of kelp forests to society and will facilitate better informed marine management and conservation decisions.By combining fisheries, nutrient, and carbon cycling data, this synthesis suggests that marine kelp forests, a dominant but often undescribed habitat, provide services with a potential value of $111,000/ha/year and a global yearly value of $500 billion.

T1  - Heat stored in the Earth system 1960–2020: where does the energy go?
AN  - 2801859586
AB  - The Earth climate system is out of energy balance, and heat has accumulated continuously over the past decades, warming the ocean, the land, the cryosphere, and the atmosphere. According to the Sixth Assessment Report by Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this planetary warming over multiple decades is human-driven and results in unprecedented and committed changes to the Earth system, with adverse impacts for ecosystems and human systems. The Earth heat inventory provides a measure of the Earth energy imbalance (EEI) and allows for quantifying how much heat has accumulated in the Earth system, as well as where the heat is stored. Here we show that the Earth system has continued to accumulate heat, with 381±61 ZJ accumulated from 1971 to 2020. This is equivalent to a heating rate (i.e., the EEI) of 0.48±0.1 W m-2. The majority, about 89 %, of this heat is stored in the ocean, followed by about 6 % on land, 1 % in the atmosphere, and about 4 % available for melting the cryosphere. Over the most recent period (2006–2020), the EEI amounts to0.76±0.2 W m-2. The Earth energy imbalance is the most fundamental global climate indicator that the scientific community and the public can use as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing anthropogenic climate change under control. Moreover, this indicator is highly complementary to other established ones like global mean surface temperature as it represents a robust measure of the rate of climate change and its future commitment. We call for an implementation of the Earth energy imbalance into the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake based on best available science. The Earth heat inventory in this study, updated from von Schuckmann et al. (2020), is underpinned by worldwide multidisciplinary collaboration and demonstrates the critical importance of concerted international efforts for climate change monitoring and community-based recommendations and we also call for urgently needed actions for enabling continuity, archiving, rescuing, and calibrating efforts to assure improved and long-term monitoring capacity of the global climate observing system. The data for the Earth heat inventory are publicly available, and more details are provided in Table 4.

T1  - Nunataryuk field campaigns: understanding the origin and fate of terrestrial organic matter in the coastal waters of the Mackenzie Delta region
AN  - 2799992630
AB  - Climate warming and related drivers of soil thermal change in the Arctic are expected to modify the distribution and dynamics of carbon contained in perennially frozen grounds. Thawing of permafrost in the Mackenzie River watershed of northwestern Canada, coupled with increases in river discharge and coastal erosion, triggers the release of terrestrial organic matter (OMt) from the largest Arctic drainage basin in North America into the Arctic Ocean. While this process is ongoing and its rate is accelerating, the fate of the newly mobilized organic matter as it transits from the watershed through the delta and into the marine system remains poorly understood. In the framework of the European Horizon 2020 Nunataryuk programme, and as part of the Work Package 4 (WP4) Coastal Waters theme, four field expeditions were conducted in the Mackenzie Delta region and southern Beaufort Sea from April to September 2019. The temporal sampling design allowed the survey of ambient conditions in the coastal waters under full ice cover prior to the spring freshet, during ice breakup in summer, and anterior to the freeze-up period in fall. To capture the fluvial–marine transition zone, and with distinct challenges related to shallow waters and changing seasonal and meteorological conditions, the field sampling was conducted in close partnership with members of the communities of Aklavik, Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, using several platforms, namely helicopters, snowmobiles, and small boats. Water column profiles of physical and optical variables were measured in situ, while surface water, groundwater, and sediment samples were collected and preserved for the determination of the composition and sources of OMt, including particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables. Here we present an overview of the standardized datasets, including hydrographic profiles, remote sensing reflectance, temperature and salinity, particle absorption, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, CDOM absorption, fluorescent dissolved organic matter intensity, suspended particulate matter, total particulate carbon, total particulate nitrogen, stable water isotopes, radon in water, bacterial abundance, and a string of phytoplankton pigments including total chlorophyll. Datasets and related metadata can be found in  (10.1594/PANGAEA.937587).

T1  - The Contribution of Environmental Science to Mental Health Research: A Scoping Review
AN  - 2799621229
AB  - Mental health is influenced by multiple complex and interacting genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors. As such, developing state-of-the-art mental health knowledge requires collaboration across academic disciplines, including environmental science. To assess the current contribution of environmental science to this field, a scoping review of the literature on environmental influences on mental health (including conditions of cognitive development and decline) was conducted. The review protocol was developed in consultation with experts working across mental health and environmental science. The scoping review included 202 English-language papers, published between 2010 and 2020 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), on environmental themes that had not already been the subject of recent systematic reviews; 26 reviews on climate change, flooding, air pollution, and urban green space were additionally considered. Studies largely focused on populations in the USA, China, or Europe and involved limited environmental science input. Environmental science research methods are primarily focused on quantitative approaches utilising secondary datasets or field data. Mental health measurement was dominated by the use of self-report psychometric scales. Measures of environmental states or exposures were often lacking in specificity (e.g., limited to the presence or absence of an environmental state). Based on the scoping review findings and our synthesis of the recent reviews, a research agenda for environmental science’s future contribution to mental health scholarship is set out. This includes recommendations to expand the geographical scope and broaden the representation of different environmental science areas, improve measurement of environmental exposure, prioritise experimental and longitudinal research designs, and giving greater consideration to variation between and within communities and the mediating pathways by which environment influences mental health. There is also considerable opportunity to increase interdisciplinarity within the field via the integration of conceptual models, the inclusion of mixed methods and qualitative approaches, as well as further consideration of the socio-political context and the environmental states that can help support good mental health. The findings were used to propose a conceptual model to parse contributions and connections between environmental science and mental health to inform future studies.

T1  - Particulate organic matter in the Lena River and its delta: from the permafrost catchment to the Arctic Ocean
AN  - 2799406773
AB  - Rapid Arctic warming accelerates permafrost thaw, causing an additional release of terrestrial organic matter (OM) into rivers and, ultimately, after transport via deltas and estuaries, to the Arctic Ocean nearshore. The majority of our understanding of nearshore OM dynamics and fate has been developed from freshwater rivers despite the likely impact of highly dynamic estuarine and deltaic environments on the transformation, storage, and age of OM delivered to coastal waters. Here, we studied particulate organic carbon (POC) dynamics in the Lena River delta and compared them with POC dynamics in the Lena River main stem along a ∼ 1600 km long transect from Yakutsk, downstream to the delta. We measured POC, total suspended matter (TSM), and carbon isotopes (δ13C and Δ14C) in POC to compare riverine and deltaic OM composition and changes in OM source and fate during transport offshore. We found that TSM and POC concentrations decreased by 70 % during transit from the main stem to the delta and Arctic Ocean. We found deltaic POC to be strongly depleted in13C relative to fluvial POC. Dual-carbon (Δ14C and δ13C) isotope mixing model analyses indicated a significant phytoplankton contribution to deltaic POC (∼ 68 ± 6 %) and suggested an additional input of permafrost-derived OM into deltaic waters (∼ 18 ± 4 % of deltaic POC originates from Pleistocene deposits vs. ∼ 5 ± 4 % in the river main stem). Despite the lower concentration of POC in the delta than in the main stem (0.41 ± 0.10 vs. 0.79 ± 0.30 mg L-1, respectively), the amount of POC derived from Yedoma deposits in deltaic waters was almost twice as large as the amount of POC of Yedoma origin in the main stem (0.07 ± 0.02 and 0.04 ± 0.02 mg L-1, respectively). We assert that estuarine and deltaic processes require consideration in order to correctly understand OM dynamics throughout Arctic nearshore coastal zones and how these processes may evolve under future climate-driven change.

T1  - Localizing Sustainable Development Goal 13 on Climate Action to Build Local Resilience to Floods in the Hunter Valley: A Literature Review
AN  - 2791711265
AB  - The realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires local governments globally to integrate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their policy and practice. In the case of the Hunter Valley Region of Australia, a key sustainable development issue is climate change-induced flooding. The localization and mainstreaming of SDG 13 on climate action can support tangible municipal climate actions in the Region. However, while it is acknowledged that SDG localization is needed to address sustainable development challenges, there is a gap in research and practice to guide local government attempts at SDG localization. This research analyzes literature on SDG localization to understand strategies, challenges and gaps that can inform localization approaches for the Hunter Valley. An analysis of the literature revealed that the implementation of SDG 13 at the local government level is a sparsely researched area, and in practice, efforts to implement SDG 13 have not been publicly communicated. Research-based recommendations for SDG 13 localization are presented to highlight the potential of integrating SDGs into pre-existing local policy so that the SDGs and their targets can support climate action and decrease disaster risk of future floods in Hunter Valley communities.

T1  - The new Kr-86 excess ice core proxy for synoptic activity: West Antarctic storminess possibly linked to Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) movement through the last deglaciation
AN  - 2786750171
AB  - Here we present a newly developed ice core gas-phase proxy that directly samples a component of the large-scale atmospheric circulation: synoptic-scale pressure variability. Surface pressure changes weakly disrupt gravitational isotopic settling in the firn layer, which is recorded in krypton-86 excess (86Krxs). The 86Krxs may therefore reflect the time-averaged synoptic pressure variability over several years (site “storminess”), but it likely cannot record individual synoptic events as ice core gas samples typically average over several years. We validate 86Krxs using late Holocene ice samples from 11 Antarctic ice cores and 1 Greenland ice core that collectively represent a wide range of surface pressure variability in the modern climate. We find a strong spatial correlation (r=-0.94, p<0.01) between site average 86Krxs and time-averaged synoptic variability from reanalysis data. The main uncertainties in the analysis are the corrections for gas loss and thermal fractionation and the relatively large scatter in the data. Limited scientific understanding of the firn physics and potential biases of 86Krxs require caution in interpreting this proxy at present. We show that Antarctic 86Krxs appears to be linked to the position of the Southern Hemisphere eddy-driven subpolar jet (SPJ), with a southern position enhancing pressure variability.We present a 86Krxs record covering the last 24 kyr from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core. Based on the empirical spatial correlation of synoptic activity and 86Krxs at various Antarctic sites, we interpret this record to show that West Antarctic synoptic activity is slightly below modern levels during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), increases during the Heinrich Stadial 1 and Younger Dryas North Atlantic cold periods, weakens abruptly at the Holocene onset, remains low during the early and mid-Holocene, and gradually increases to its modern value. The WAIS Divide 86Krxs record resembles records of monsoon intensity thought to reflect changes in the meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on orbital and millennial timescales such that West Antarctic storminess is weaker when the ITCZ is displaced northward and stronger when it is displaced southward. We interpret variations in synoptic activity as reflecting movement of the South Pacific SPJ in parallel to the ITCZ migrations, which is the expected zonal mean response of the eddy-driven jet in models and proxy data. Past changes to Pacific climate and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may amplify the signal of the SPJ migration. Our interpretation is broadly consistent with opal flux records from the Pacific Antarctic zone thought to reflect wind-driven upwelling.We emphasize that 86Krxs is a new proxy, and more work is called for to confirm, replicate, and better understand these results; until such time, our conclusions regarding past atmospheric dynamics remain speculative. Current scientific understanding of firn air transport and trapping is insufficient to explain all the observed variations in86Krxs. A list of suggested future studies is provided.

T1  - A Comprehensive Model for Developing SME Net Zero Capability Incorporating Grey Literature
AN  - 2785244611
AB  - SMEs collectively account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions and so there is a need for urgent action to be taken by SMEs in the journey to achieve net zero. In this article, we provide a comprehensive conceptual framework for SMEs to draw from in the journey towards net zero by synthesizing the academic and grey literature. By bringing together key strands of the literature, we derive a conceptual model that provides a clear pathway for SMEs to embark on their net zero journeys. The framework we invent involves understanding the position of the SME in the value chain, understanding the pressures from stakeholders, undertaking greenhouse gas accounting to measure current levels of carbon emissions, undertaking internal changes towards the net zero agenda, undertaking external facing changes towards the net zero agenda, uncoupling, community participation, and updating business activities regularly. This model acts as a progressive decision-making and continuous improvement framework that will be an asset to SMEs as they undertake net zero activities. Overall, the paper contributes to the sustainability literature by being the first to synthesize the academic and grey literature to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for SMEs to attain net zero.

T1  - Macro Uncertainty Impacts on ESG Performance and Carbon Emission Reduction Targets
AN  - 2785244596
AB  - This study examines the impact of three macro uncertainty factors: economic policy uncertainty (EPU), political instability (PIS), and cultural uncertainty avoidance (UA), on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and carbon emission reduction targets. Additionally, we examine whether these macro factors are affected by the profitability of the company. Using an unbalanced sample of companies located in the USA, China, and the UK during the period 2013–2020, results show that during times of economic uncertainty, companies are more likely to engage in ESG activities, including establishing emission reduction targets. Companies in countries with lower levels of political stability (PS) exhibit greater levels of social and environmental engagements, and companies operating in societies that tolerate risks, including the risk associated with climate change, are more likely to have better ESG performance and be committed to emission reduction targets. The results also suggest that profitable companies are more likely to deal with uncertain environments successfully, as they have the required resources to invest in ESG. The study suggests several practical implications for managers and policymakers.

T1  - Optimal Hierarchical Control for Smart Grid Inverters Using Stability Margin Evaluating Transient Voltage for Photovoltaic System
AN  - 2785193885
AB  - This research proposed an optimal control approach for a smart grid electrical system with photovoltaic generation, where the control variables are voltage and frequency, which aims to improve the performance through addressing the need for a balance between the minimization of error and the operational cost. The proposed control scheme incorporates the latest advancements in heuristics and hierarchical control strategies to provide an efficient and effective solution for the smart grid electrical system control. Implementing the optimal control scheme in a smart power grid is expected to bring significant benefits, such as the reduced impact of renewable energy sources, improved stability, reliability and efficiency of the power grid, and enhanced overall performance. The optimal coefficient values are found by minimizing the cost functions, which leads to a more efficient system performance. The voltage output response of the system in a steady state is over-damped, with no overshoot, but with a 5% oscillation around the target voltage level that remains consistent. Despite the complexity of nonlinear elements’ behavior and multiple system interactions, the response time is fast and the settling time is less than 0.4 s. This means that even with an increase in load, the system output still meets the power and voltage requirements of the system, ensuring efficient and effective performance of the smart grid electrical systems.

T1  - Towards a Combined Physical and Social Evaluation of Climate Vulnerability in Coastal Urban Megacities
AN  - 2779698083
AB  - Coastal urban megacities across Asia face significant risks from climate change, including coastal flooding, high temperatures, urban heat island impacts and air pollution. These hazards are associated with negative impacts on infrastructure, communities and the environment. To identify the current intensity of climate change impacts in coastal urban megacities, an integrated evaluation method is needed. Firstly, the present study assesses the climate change impacts of Guangzhou, a Chinese coastal urban megacity, for both physical and social aspects. This study includes 60 years of time-series data for 1960–2020 to examine temperatures, precipitation, humidity and air pollution in Guangzhou city. At the same time, a survey was conducted between April and July 2022 in this megacity and collected the views of 336 people on climate change and its associated environmental impacts. Secondly, the Ganzhou city results are compared with existing data from similar nearby cities to evaluate the diverse climate change trends. Results show that during 1961-1990, the city received the most rainfall in May, reaching 283.6 mm. From 1990 to 2020, June recorded the highest rainfall of 356.6 mm and shows an increase of 73 mm during that period. The very severe monsoon season brought an increased risk of flooding. Results also revealed that the warmest month is July, and the coldest month is January, and both months showed increased temperatures of 0.60 ℃. Comparison results revealed that Guangzhou is not the only city which scored increased highest temperatures; other nearby cities including Heyuan, Shantou and Shaoguan also scored increased highest temperatures. The survey reveals that the majority of respondents (75%) perceived the increased frequency of extreme weather, including typhoons, heavy rainfall and multiple days of hot weather, such as higher temperatures and an increased number of hot days. In the responses to the questions related to the heat island effect, more than 80% of residents are aware of the existence of the heat island and its impacts. People believe that the primary causes of the urban heat island problem are industrial production and anthropogenic heat generated by the city. These results will be helpful to local and national policy and decision makers to revise and/or develop new strategies to improve the environment and quality of life in coastal megacities, particularly Ganzhou.

T1  - Understanding Rare Earth Elements as Critical Raw Materials
AN  - 2775017539
AB  - The boom in technological advances in recent decades has led to increased demand for rare earth elements (REEs) (also known as rare earth metals) across various industries with wide-ranging industrial applications, including in the clean energy sector, but with some environmental, economic, and social footprint concerns. This paper reviews the complexities of the production, consumption, and reuse or recovery of REEs, presenting current trends in terms of potentials and challenges associated with this. This paper in particular focuses on the supply, demand, and (environmental and economic) sustainability of REEs, as a subset of critical raw materials. It does so via a critical stocktaking of key discussions and debates in the field over the past 15 years up until now, through a thematic analysis of the published and gray (policy) literature with a grounded theory approach. The paper finds that carefully balanced lifecycle sustainability assessments are needed for assessing the respective dimensions of the extraction, processing, and reuse or recovery methods for different types of REE sources and supplies to meet current and future demands. It furthermore diagnoses the need for taking into account some shifts and substitutions among REEs also for reasons of cost and locational supplies for the security of supply. Finally, the paper provides some overall policy recommendations for addressing current problems, with a conceptual framing of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

T1  - Global dataset on seagrass meadow structure, biomass and production
AN  - 2771267781
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide valuable socio-ecological ecosystem services, including a key role in climate change mitigation and adaption. Understanding the natural history of seagrass meadows across environmental gradients is crucial to deciphering the role of seagrasses in the global ocean. In this data collation, spatial and temporal patterns in seagrass meadow structure, biomass and production data are presented as a function of biotic and abiotic habitat characteristics. The biological traits compiled include measures of meadow structure (e.g. percent cover and shoot density), biomass (e.g. above-ground biomass) and production (e.g. shoot production). Categorical factors include bioregion, geotype (coastal or estuarine), genera and year of sampling. This dataset contains data extracted from peer-reviewed publications published between 1975 and 2020 based on a Web of Science search and includes 11 data variables across 12 seagrass genera. The dataset excludes data from mesocosm and field experiments, contains 14 271 data points extracted from 390 publications and is publicly available on the PANGAEA® data repository (10.1594/PANGAEA.929968; Strydom et al., 2021). The top five most studied genera are Zostera, Thalassia, Cymodocea, Halodule and Halophila (84 % of data), and the least studied genera are Phyllospadix, Amphibolis and Thalassodendron (2.3 % of data). The data hotspot bioregion is the Tropical Indo-Pacific (25 % of data) followed by the Tropical Atlantic (21 %), whereas data for the other four bioregions are evenly spread (ranging between 13 and 15 % of total data within each bioregion). From the data compiled, 57 % related to seagrass biomass and 33 % to seagrass structure, while the least number of data were related to seagrass production (11 % of data). This data collation can inform several research fields beyond seagrass ecology, such as the development of nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation, which include readership interested in blue carbon, engineering, fisheries, global change, conservation and policy.

T1  - Rapid eco-phenotypic feedback and the temperature response of biomass dynamics
AN  - 2770579453
AB  - Biomass dynamics capture information on population dynamics and ecosystem-level processes (e.g., changes in production over time). Understanding how rising temperatures associated with global climate change influence biomass dynamics is thus a pressing issue in ecology. The total biomass of a species depends on its density and its average mass. Consequently, disentangling how biomass dynamics responds to increasingly warm and variable temperatures ultimately depends on understanding how temperature influences both density and mass dynamics. Here, we address this issue by keeping track of experimental microbial populations growing to carrying capacity for 15 days at two different temperatures, and in the presence and absence of temperature variability. We develop a simple mathematical expression to partition the contribution of changes in density and mass to changes in biomass and assess how temperature responses in either one influence biomass shifts. Moreover, we use time-series analysis (Convergent Cross Mapping) to address how temperature and temperature variability influence reciprocal effects of density on mass and vice versa. We show that temperature influences biomass through its effects on density and mass dynamics, which have opposite effects on biomass and can offset each other. We also show that temperature variability influences biomass, but that effect is independent of any effects on density or mass dynamics. Last, we show that reciprocal effects of density and mass shift significantly across temperature regimes, suggesting that rapid and environment-dependent eco-phenotypic dynamics underlie biomass responses. Overall, our results connect temperature effects on population and phenotypic dynamics to explain how biomass responds to temperature regimes, thus shedding light on processes at play in cosmopolitan and abundant microbes as the world experiences increasingly warm and variable temperatures.

T1  - Integrating carbon stocks and landscape connectivity for nature-based climate solutions
AN  - 2770579365
AB  - Actions to protect against biodiversity loss and climate change will require a framework that addresses synergies between these interrelated issues. In this study, we present methods for identifying areas important for the implementation of nature-based climate solutions and biodiversity conservation by intersecting high-resolution spatial data for carbon storage and landscape connectivity. We explored the spatial congruence of carbon and connectivity in Ontario, Canada and examined effectiveness of current protected areas coverage. We found a weak positive relationship between carbon stocks and landscape connectivity; however, our maps revealed large hotspots, with high values of both indices, throughout the boreal forest and northern peatlands and smaller, isolated hotspots, in the settled landscapes of the south. Location of hotspots varied depending on whether we considered forest or soil carbon. Further, our results show that current protected and conserved areas in Ontario only cover 13% of landscapes with the highest values for both carbon storage and connectivity. Protection or restoration of areas that maximize the co-benefits of carbon storage and connectivity would make significant contributions toward ambitious national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity.

T1  - lakeCoSTR: A tool to facilitate use of Landsat Collection 2 to estimate lake surface water temperatures
AN  - 2770526752
AB  - Although remote sensing of lake surface water temperature has been ongoing for decades and has led to important discoveries regarding the warming of lake surface temperature in some regions, the ability to access and use remote sensing data is still primarily limited to remote sensing experts. Effective use of remote sensing data involves technical skills in coding (often in multiple programming languages), application of appropriate atmospheric corrections, and integrating spatially heterogeneous remote sensing data with in situ data obtained at specific geographic locations. To improve access to remote sensing data and broaden the understanding of changes in lake surface water temperature over the past four decades, we created lakeCoSTR (lake Collection 2 Surface Temperature Retrieval), a user-friendly, cloud-based script that gives ecologists lacking specialized training in remote sensing the ability to access the Landsat Collection 2 temperature estimates for lakes with a surface area of at least 0.4 ha. Additionally, if in situ data are provided, a paired dataset can be created within the tool. To demonstrate lakeCoSTR, we retrieved surface water temperature data for a lake with a long monitoring history, Lake Sunapee, NH, USA, and compared long-term surface temperature trends between data obtained via lakeCoSTR and in situ measurements. When compared with Landsat Collection 1 temperature estimates derived from a single-channel algorithm, the Landsat Collection 2 data from lakeCoSTR required no calibration to in situ data. This suggests that lakeCoSTR can be used to document temporal trends in lakes and to reprocess analyses that relied on Collection 1 data. From 1983 until 2020, remotely sensed surface water temperature estimates at Lake Sunapee increased by 0.07–0.09°C year−1 during July and August, a trend that agreed with long-term in situ record. As climate change continues to impact freshwater systems, a better understanding of long-term temperature data will be vital. Remotely sensed data, like those acquired using lakeCoSTR, may provide a window into temperature trends for lakes.

T1  - Rethinking Estuary Urbanism—Preparing Australian Estuary Cities for Changes to Come in the Climate and Biodiversity Emergency
AN  - 2767300211
AB  - This research investigates the challenges and opportunities of urban estuaries exposed to spatial, urban, and environmental shifts exacerbated by climate change, ecological disturbances, and population growth, taking the cities of Perth, Western Australia and Newcastle, New South Wales, as case studies. Approaching the design of estuary cities in the Climate Century demands a form of estuary urbanism and new paradigms in design, which embrace the constant presence of water. Water becomes the instrument of change to re-think the design of the city and its relationship with the non-built environment since the climate crisis is also a water crisis. Adaptation and mitigation strategies are still emerging fields in design and planning disciplines. Design disciplines can strongly contribute to generating site-specific climate-adaptative responses while re-establishing the connection between built and natural environments, improving ecological balance and spatial quality, and promoting well-being and cultural values. The methodology involves both analytical and projective-explorative methods promoting a site-specific approach, working across scales and disciplines to understand urban estuaries within larger catchments and as complex hydrological and ecological systems. A fundamental goal is the creation of site-specific design strategies to operate in low to medium-density precincts, leveraging water and nature as design tools to improve urban resilience and liveability. There is capacity here to establish design methods and principles that inform future practices through urbanism responding to dynamic ecological and water systems and the unpredictability effects of climate change.

T1  - Global patterns of climate change impacts on desert bird communities
AN  - 2765229057
AB  - The world’s warm deserts are predicted to experience disproportionately large temperature increases due to climate change, yet the impacts on global desert biodiversity remain poorly understood. Because species in warm deserts live close to their physiological limits, additional warming may induce local extinctions. Here, we combine climate change projections with biophysical models and species distributions to predict physiological impacts of climate change on desert birds globally. Our results show heterogeneous impacts between and within warm deserts. Moreover, spatial patterns of physiological impacts do not simply mirror air temperature changes. Climate change refugia, defined as warm desert areas with high avian diversity and low predicted physiological impacts, are predicted to persist in varying extents in different desert realms. Only a small proportion (<20%) of refugia fall within existing protected areas. Our analysis highlights the need to increase protection of refugial areas within the world’s warm deserts to protect species from climate change.Desert-dwelling species are adapted to high temperatures, but further warming may push them beyond their physiological limits. Here, the authors integrate biophysical models and species distributions to project physiological impacts of climate change on desert birds globally and identify potential refugia.

T1  - A Review of Microgrid Energy Management Strategies from the Energy Trilemma Perspective
AN  - 2761177396
AB  - The energy sector is undergoing a paradigm shift among all the stages, from generation to the consumer end. The affordable, flexible, secure supply–demand balance due to an increase in renewable energy sources (RESs) penetration, technological advancements in monitoring and control, and the active nature of distribution system components have led to the development of microgrid (MG) energy systems. The intermittency and uncertainty of RES, as well as the controllable nature of MG components such as different types of energy generation sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, heating, and cooling systems are required to deploy efficient energy management systems (EMSs). Multi-agent systems (MASs) and model predictive control (MPC) approaches have been widely used in recent studies and have characteristics that address most of the EMS challenges. The advantages of these methods are due to the independent characteristics and nature of MAS, the predictive nature of MPC, and their ability to provide affordable, flexible, and secure MG operation. Therefore, for the first time, this state-of-the-art review presents a classification of the MG control and optimization methods, their objectives, and help in understanding the MG operational and EMS challenges from the perspective of the energy trilemma (flexibility, affordability, and security). The control and optimization architectures achievable with MAS and MPC methods predominantly identified and discussed. Furthermore, future research recommendations in MG-EMS in terms of energy trilemma associated with MAS, MPC methods, stability, resiliency, scalability improvements, and algorithm developments are presented to benefit the research community.

AN  - 2760707196
AB  - Purpose>This paper aims to address a gap in investigating specific impacts of climate change on mental health in the Pacific region, a region prone to extreme events. This paper reports on a study on the connections between climate change, public health, extreme weather and climate events (EWEs), livelihoods and mental health, focusing on the Pacific region Islands countries.Design/methodology/approach>This paper deploys two main methods. The first is a bibliometric analysis to understand the state of the literature. For example, the input data for term co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer is bibliometric data of publications downloaded from Scopus. The second method describes case studies, which outline some of the EWEs the region has faced, which have also impacted mental health.Findings>The results suggest that the increased frequency of EWEs in the region contributes to a greater incidence of mental health problems. These, in turn, are associated with a relatively low level of resilience and greater vulnerability. The findings illustrate the need for improvements in the public health systems of Pacific nations so that they are in a better position to cope with the pressures posed by a changing environment.Originality/value>This paper contributes to the current literature by identifying the links between climate change, extreme events, environmental health and mental health consequences in the Pacific Region. It calls for greater awareness of the subject matter of mental health among public health professionals so that they may be better able to recognise the symptoms and relate them to their climate-related causes and co-determinant factors.

T1  - Green endoscopy: British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), Joint Accreditation Group (JAG) and Centre for Sustainable Health (CSH) joint consensus on practical measures for environmental sustainability in endoscopy
AN  - 2747893387
AB  - GI endoscopy is highly resource-intensive with a significant contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste generation. Sustainable endoscopy in the context of climate change is now the focus of mainstream discussions between endoscopy providers, units and professional societies. In addition to broader global challenges, there are some specific measures relevant to endoscopy units and their practices, which could significantly reduce environmental impact. Awareness of these issues and guidance on practical interventions to mitigate the carbon footprint of GI endoscopy are lacking. In this consensus, we discuss practical measures to reduce the impact of endoscopy on the environment applicable to endoscopy units and practitioners. Adoption of these measures will facilitate and promote new practices and the evolution of a more sustainable specialty.

T1  - Appraising the Water‐Energy‐Food Nexus From a Sustainable Development Perspective: A Maturing Paradigm?
AN  - 2758349031
AB  - The water‐energy‐food (WEF) nexus is a prominent approach for addressing today's sustainable development challenges. In our critical appraisal of the WEF, covering different approaches, drivers, enablers, and applications, we emphasize the situation across the Global South (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean). Here, WEF research covers at least 23 focal domains. We find that the nexus is still a maturing paradigm primarily rooted in a physical and natural sciences framing, which is itself embedded in a neoliberal securities narrative. While providing insights and tools to address the systemic interdependencies between resource sectors whose exploitation, degradation, and sub‐optimal management contribute to (un)sustainable development, there is still insufficient engagement with social, political, and economic dimensions. Progress related to climate, urbanization, and resource consumption is encouraging, but while governance and finance are central enablers of current and future nexus systems, gaps remain in relation to implementation and operationalization. Harnessing the nexus for sustainable development across the Global South means recognizing that it is more than a biophysical system, but also a multi‐scale complex of people, institutions, and infrastructure, affected by history and context. Addressing this complexity requires alternative and possibly challenging perspectives to counter dominant narratives, and manage problems associated with policy integration, trade‐offs, and winners and losers. We outline 10 emergent research areas that we think can contribute to this endeavor and enable the nexus to be a stronger policy force.

T1  - Developing polar data-cylinders to map spatiotemporal changes in Arctic sea ice
AN  - 2756504023
AB  - Complex ecosystems characterize the Arctic Region, which experiences rapid environmental changes due to climate change. These changes are happening spatially as much as temporally. Spatiotemporal interactive three-dimensional visualization of environmental phenomena is eye-catching, while creating the foundations for the rapid understanding of Arctic complexity. The Arctic is a circumpolar region; cylinders seem suitable visual media for related data. In this case study, the visualization of anomalies of the sea ice illustrates abnormal changes, helping the viewer/user to focus on that filtered information rather than becoming lost in a multitude of information. A holistic view of dynamic environmental changes in a stand-alone visual could impact the quick understanding, response and policymaking regarding the visualized phenomena.

T1  - Community listening sessions: an approach for facilitating collective reflection on environmental learning and behavior in everyday life
AN  - 2753886833
AB  - Collaborative research approaches can promote social learning by curating a structure that facilitates inclusive dialogue and reflection. Within an epistemological frame that upholds notions of emergence rather than extraction, such modes can foster collective reflection in ways that contribute to reversing traditional notions of expertise. In this paper, we describe ‘Community Listening Sessions’, an approach drawing on focus group, learning circle, and participatory research literature. We developed Community Listening Sessions to study the interactional contexts of environmental learning – an inherently social, collective process. In our initial application, through 14 listening sessions hosted across the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA), we engaged more than 100 community members in discussing how they learn about and take action related to the environment in their daily lives. We make recommendations for future use of Community Listening Sessions for collecting qualitative data in a participatory, equitable way in what can be challenging, high-social-cost discussions, yet those that are critical for addressing issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, socio-environmental justice, and others that are essential to the future of our species and planet.

T1  - The circum-Antarctic ice-shelves respond to a more positive Southern Annular Mode with regionally varied melting
AN  - 2679469747
AB  - The Southern Hemisphere cryosphere has recently shown regionally-contrasted responses to climate change, in particular to the positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode. However, the understanding of the impacts of this mode on ice-shelf basal melt at a circum-Antarctic scale is still limited. Here, we performed idealized experiments with a pan-Antarctic regional ice-shelf cavity-resolving ocean—sea-ice model for different phases of the Southern Annular Mode. We show that positive phases lead to increased upwelling and subsurface ocean temperature and salinity close to ice shelves, while the opposite occurs for negative phases. A one-standard-deviation increase of the Southern Annular Mode leads to a net basal mass loss of 40 Gt yr−1, with strong regional contrasts: increased ice-shelf basal melt in the Bellingshausen and Western Pacific sectors and the opposite response in the Amundsen sector. Estimates of 1000–1200 and 2090–2100 ice-shelf basal melt changes due to the Southern Annular Mode are −86.6 Gt yr−1 and 55.0 to 164.9 Gt yr−1, respectively, compared to the present.Positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode lead to enhanced basal melt overall in the Antarctic ice shelves, with strong losses in the Bellingshausen and Western Pacific sectors and gains in the Amundsen Sea, according to ice-ocean model experiments.

T1  - Delivering an off-grid transition to sustainable energy in Ethiopia and Mozambique
AN  - 2664951304
AB  - BackgroundOff-grid and decentralized energy systems have emerged as an alternative to facilitate energy access and resilience in a flexible, adaptable way, particularly for communities that do not have reliable access to centralized energy networks both in rural and urban areas. Much research to date on community energy systems has focused on their deployment in Europe and North America. This paper advances these debates by looking at how community energy systems can support energy transitions in Africa. Specifically, it asks: what role can community energy systems play in the energy transition in East and Southern Africa?ResultsThis article investigates the potential for community energy to foster sustainable and just energy transitions in two countries in East and Southern Africa, namely Ethiopia and Mozambique. To do so, it explores transformations in Ethiopia and Mozambique’s energy systems through the lens of energy landscapes. This concept enables us to situate energy transitions within recent developments in energy governance and to understand current and future possibilities for change through the involvement of communities that currently lack access to reliable and clean energy. Our results show that when countries face the prospects of lucrative energy investments in natural gas or large hydropower, renewables are often deprioritized. Their suitability to address energy challenges and access gaps is de-emphasized, even though there is little evidence that investment in large-scale generation can handle the energy needs of the most disadvantaged groups. Initiatives and policies supporting community-focused renewable energy have remained limited in both countries. They tend to be designed from the top-down and focused on rural areas when they exist.ConclusionsEnergy transitions in Ethiopia and Mozambique, and many other countries with significant gaps in access to centralized energy systems, require putting inclusivity at the forefront to ensure that energy policies and infrastructure support the well-being of society as a whole. As long as investments in off-grid energy continue to depend on international organizations’ goodwill or development aid programs outside the ambit of national energy plans, energy access gaps will remain unaddressed, and there will not be a genuine and just transition to sustainable energy.

T1  - The NIH Climate Change and Health Initiative and Strategic Framework: addressing the threat of climate change to health
AN  - 2739729365
AB  - Extreme weather events associated with climate change are becoming more frequent and severe.2 Climate change contributes to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, exacerbates threats to human health across various health conditions, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions, and increases the risk of water-borne and food-borne diseases, malnutrition, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and extreme-weather-related morbidities and mortality.3 Environmental and social stressors are altered by climate change, affecting people's vulnerability to climate threats and their ability to avoid, respond to, or adapt to them.

Crucially, climate change has a disproportionate effect on communities worldwide already experiencing social and environmental inequalities.4 The leadership of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognises the urgent need for a more concerted and collective effort by the agency to advance understanding of the effects of climate change on individual and public health.

In 2010, NIH, along with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), led an interagency working group that developed the first federal climate change and health research needs assessment.4 NIH has conducted research and other activities in support of climate change and health science during the past two decades, but grant funding has been limited.

T1  - Beyond early self-evacuation from bushfires: factors influencing non-evacuation of at-risk communities
AN  - 2747924527
AB  - Bushfire is a devastating natural hazard. Contrary to bushfire policy on catastrophic fires, some householders prefer to stay and defend their properties. In addition, more frequent destructive events have been predicted because of climate change. To date, little attention has been paid to factors concerning why householders decide not to evacuate, especially for at-risk communities. Recent bushfire fatalities underscore the need to understand the factors influencing decision-making among residents in at-risk communities. This study addresses this imperative by identifying factors through a systematic literature review. Out of 142 articles extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1999 – 2020, 32 were found relevant. Based on the rationalism classification of knowledge in psychology, these were categorized into information, social, protection, and operational factors. The factors may inform further studies involving predictors of residents’ non-evacuation from bushfire hazards. In addition, the significant factors can be leveraged towards early self-evacuation, which could reduce bushfire fatalities and mental health impacts among the residents.

T1  - Policy interventions for disaster-related internal displacement in Australia
AN  - 2747924524
AB  - It is projected that internal displacement of populations in the aftermath of natural hazards will occur more frequently due to climate change [1]. However, to date, 35 nations have implemented policy or legal protections at a national level to plan for displacement or to protect the rights of internally displaced people (IDPs) [2]. While no cohesive national strategy for internal displacement has been developed in Australia, a thematic analysis of climate change, disasters, and emergency management policies was conducted to determine if Australian policy acknowledges the issue of internal displacement or plans for its effects. The study found that Australian policy fails to recognise the needs of IDPs and the threat of displacement risk. The failure of national governments to implement policy and legislation on internal displacement has the potential to undermine the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and stifle the progression of international initiatives such as the Sendai Framework and the Paris Climate Agreement. Furthermore, the lack of recognition for the issue at the governmental level contributes to disaster displacement risk creation, placing vulnerable populations at risk of displacement and associated stressors. As displacement governance is an integral part of addressing the human impacts of climate change and natural hazards [3], this research suggests how displacement risk could be reduced in Australia through national-level policy interventions.

T1  - A High-End Estimate of Sea Level Rise for Practitioners
AN  - 2739204635
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) is a long-lasting consequence of climate change because global anthropogenic warming takes centuries to millennia to equilibrate for the deep ocean and ice sheets. SLR projections based on climate models support policy analysis, risk assessment and adaptation planning today, despite their large uncertainties. The central range of the SLR distribution is estimated by process-based models. However, risk-averse practitioners often require information about plausible future conditions that lie in the tails of the SLR distribution, which are poorly defined by existing models. Here, a community effort combining scientists and practitioners builds on a framework of discussing physical evidence to quantify high-end global SLR for practitioners. The approach is complementary to the IPCC AR6 report and provides further physically plausible high-end scenarios. High-end estimates for the different SLR components are developed for two climate scenarios at two timescales. For global warming of +2°C in 2100 (RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6) relative to pre-industrial values our high-end global SLR estimates are up to 0.9 m in 2100 and 2.5 m in 2300. Similarly, for a (RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5), we estimate up to 1.6 m in 2100 and up to 10.4 m in 2300. The large and growing differences between the scenarios beyond 2100 emphasize the long-term benefits of mitigation. However, even a modest 2°C warming may cause multi-meter SLR on centennial time scales with profound consequences for coastal areas. Earlier high-end assessments focused on instability mechanisms in Antarctica, while here we emphasize the importance of the timing of ice shelf collapse around Antarctica. This is highly uncertain due to low understanding of the driving processes. Hence both process understanding and emission scenario control high-end SLR.

T1  - Space matters: reducing energy disparity in Nepal through spatially equitable renewable energy subsidies
AN  - 2727677467
AB  - Abstract:Affordability is a major barrier to the adoption of clean energy technologies in low-income countries, which is partly why many governments provide subsidies to offset some of the upfront (installation) costs. However, simple administrative rules might not fully account for economic geography, resulting in lower subsidies for remote areas. Using regression analysis on a rich dataset of adoption, cost and subsidy for about 4000 Nepalese Village Development Committees over 22 years, we show that administratively determined lumpsum subsidies disproportionately hurt remote communities. Simulations show that adjusting the subsidy spatially to reflect the geographic cost of living, can increase clean technology adoption. Thus, spatial targeting of subsidies is key to accelerating energy access in remote settings such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya.

T1  - Modelling the historic and projected near-surface temperature trends across Canada
AN  - 2726067265
AB  - This article explores the impact that Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1-2.6 and 5-8.5 will have on near-surface temperature across Canada. This is achieved through the use of model ensembles, made up of CMIP5 data, to establish both the historic record of near-surface temperature across Canada, as well as how this is predicted to change in the future given the two SSP emission scenarios. The conclusions drawn from this modelling and analysis is valuable in the context of sustainable development and climate mitigation and adaptation discussions. Specifically, an understanding of the spatial extent of warming trends across Canada will allow for a more specific and tailored approach to be taken towards adaptation and ensure appropriate measures are taken in good time.

T1  - Comparing Life Cycle Assessment of Fish Preservation Method on Fishing Vessels in Indonesia
AN  - 2726050956
AB  - The economic benefit that the fishermen can obtain primarily depends on the quality of their catches. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the caught fish stays fresh until entering the market. The most common fish preservation on traditional fishing boats in Indonesia is block ice, which must be carried in the fish hold from the home port. In comparison, another alternative method for fish preservation is the Flake Ice machine that can produce ice on-board. The study on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted on these two fish preservation methods to understand the environmental impact of each technique. For undertaking the assessments, LCA software known as SimaPro was employed. The system boundary for the LCA about fish preservation applied the “well to wheels” approach and covered the whole service life of the vessel for the full consecutive 20 years of operation. The functional unit for the assessment was fish preservation of 4 tonnes during a 7-day fishing trip. The input of the evaluation was the materials and energy required to produce the amount of ice or to operate a refrigeration system for each year of the vessel’s operation, with a total of 30 trips per year. The paper explored the environmental impact of these two fish preservation methods in terms of Ozone Layer Depletion and Global Warming.

T1  - Green endoscopy: British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), Joint Accreditation Group (JAG) and Centre for Sustainable Health (CSH) joint consensus on practical measures for environmental sustainability in endoscopy
AN  - 2724928450
AB  - GI endoscopy is highly resource-intensive with a significant contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste generation. Sustainable endoscopy in the context of climate change is now the focus of mainstream discussions between endoscopy providers, units and professional societies. In addition to broader global challenges, there are some specific measures relevant to endoscopy units and their practices, which could significantly reduce environmental impact. Awareness of these issues and guidance on practical interventions to mitigate the carbon footprint of GI endoscopy are lacking. In this consensus, we discuss practical measures to reduce the impact of endoscopy on the environment applicable to endoscopy units and practitioners. Adoption of these measures will facilitate and promote new practices and the evolution of a more sustainable specialty.

T1  - Climate change and non-migration — exploring the role of place relations in rural and coastal Bangladesh
AN  - 2721075155
AB  - Abstract Of growing research and policy interest are the experiences of people living under conditions of climate change–induced environmental stress, which either are unable to migrate (sometimes described as a ‘trapped population’) or are seemingly unwilling to do so (sometimes described as the ‘voluntarily immobile’). This paper problematises and expands upon these binary categories: examining the complex dimensionality of non-migration as a form of place relations, explored through qualitative study of rural and coastal Bangladeshi communities. Through 60 semi-structured interviews of individuals from four communities in the Kalapara region, the analysis proffers four qualitatively derived and inter-related dimensions of voluntary and involuntary non-migration framed as a form of place relations. These four dimensions concern the following: (1) livelihood opportunities, (2) place obduracy, (3) risk perceptions, and (4) social-structural constraints, with the interplay between these elements explaining diverse non-migratory experiences. In our analysis, ‘place obduracy’ is introduced as a concept to describe the differential speed of environmental change and socio-cultural adaptation responses to explain non-migratory experiences. Our discussion provides insight into how to best support non-migrant people’s adaptive capacity in the face of growing climate emergency.

T1  - Using temporal genomics to understand contemporary climate change responses in wildlife
AN  - 2718854327
AB  - Monitoring the evolutionary responses of species to ongoing global climate change is critical for informing conservation. Population genomic studies that use samples from multiple time points (“temporal genomics”) are uniquely able to make direct observations of change over time. Consequently, only temporal studies can show genetic erosion or spatiotemporal changes in population structure. Temporal genomic studies directly examining climate change effects are currently rare but will likely increase in the coming years due to their high conservation value. Here, we highlight four key genetic indicators that can be monitored using temporal genomics to understand how species are responding to climate change. All indicators crucially rely on having a suitable baseline that accurately represents the past condition of the population, and we discuss aspects of study design that must be considered to achieve this.

T1  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the extent of an extreme heat event
AN  - 2716764016
AB  - Evidence of global warming induced from the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests more frequent warm days and heat waves. The concept of an extreme heat event (EHE), defined locally based on exceedance of a suitable local threshold, enables us to capture the notion of a period of persistent extremely high temperatures. Modeling for extreme heat events is customarily implemented using time series of temperatures collected at a set of locations. Since spatial dependence is anticipated in the occurrence of EHE’s, a joint model for the time series, incorporating spatial dependence is needed. Recent work by Schliep et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc 184(3):1070–1092, 2021) develops a space-time model based on a point-referenced collection of temperature time series that enables the prediction of both the incidence and characteristics of EHE’s occurring at any location in a study region. The contribution here is to introduce a formal definition of the notion of the spatial extent of an extreme heat event and then to employ output from the Schliep et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A Stat Soc 184(3):1070–1092, 2021) modeling work to illustrate the notion. For a specified region and a given day, the definition takes the form of a block average of indicator functions over the region. Our risk assessment examines extents for the Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón in northeastern Spain. We calculate daily, seasonal and decadal averages of the extents for two subregions in this comunidad. We generalize our definition to capture extents of persistence of extreme heat and make comparisons across decades to reveal evidence of increasing extent over time.

T1  - Nitrogen wet deposition stoichiometry: the role of organic nitrogen, seasonality, and snow
AN  - 2715618406
AB  - Wet deposition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) is declining nationally, accompanied by a shift in stoichiometry from predominantly oxidized to reduced forms of N. Stoichiometric trends that include the organic fraction of N wet deposition have yet to be assessed in light of anthropogenic pressures and global change, including shifting seasonality. Here we use 17 years of weekly, year-round wet deposition data from a temperate watershed in New Hampshire (USA) to assess long-term and seasonal trends in NO3−, NH4+, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and quantify the dependence of N stoichiometry on precipitation type (rain or snow). Concentration, load, and relative abundance of DON are increasing, a pattern previously unreported in the U.S. Deposition of total dissolved nitrogen at this site is declining, but is increasingly depleted in NH4+, contrary to national trends. The stoichiometry of inorganic N is highly sensitive to precipitation type with snow containing significantly more NO3− than rain, which was relatively enriched in NH4+. The effects of climate change on seasonality such as warmer winters could result in a greater proportion of precipitation entering the biosphere as rain that is relatively enriched in reduced N, with significant implications for watershed biogeochemical cycles at the regional scale. This study demonstrates variability in contemporary N deposition inputs including trends in stoichiometry and explores the role of organic N and seasonality in regulating inter- and intra- variability in N deposition stoichiometry.

T1  - Biological lability of terrestrial DOM increases CO2 outgassing across Arctic shelves
AN  - 2715616208
AB  - Arctic shelf seas receive greater quantities of river runoff than any other ocean region and are experiencing increased freshwater loads and associated terrestrial matter inputs since recent decades. Amplified terrestrial permafrost thaw and coastal erosion is exposing previously frozen organic matter, enhancing its mobilization and release to nearshore regions. Changing terrestrial dissolved organic matter (terr-DOM) loads and composition may alter shelf primary productivity and respiration, ultimately affecting net regional CO2 air–sea fluxes. However, the future evolution of Arctic Ocean climate feedbacks are highly dependent upon the biological degradability of terr-DOM in coastal waters, a factor often omitted in modelling studies. Here, we assess the sensitivity of CO2 air–sea fluxes from East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) waters to changing terr-DOM supply and degradability using a biogeochemical model explicitly accounting for bacteria dynamics and shifting terr-DOM composition. We find increasing terr-DOM loads and degradability trigger a series of biogeochemical and ecological processes shifting ESAS waters from a net sink to a net source of CO2, even after accounting for strengthening coastal productivity by additional land-derived nutrients. Our results suggest that future projected inputs of labile terr-DOM from peat and permafrost thaw may strongly increase the CO2 efflux from the Arctic shelf sea, causing currently unquantified positive feedback to climate change.

T1  - Nitrogen and Sulfur Deposition Reductions Projected to Partially Restore Forest Soil Conditions in the US Northeast, While Understory Composition Continues to Shift with Future Climate Change
AN  - 2709801326
AB  - Abstract Human activities have dramatically increased nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition, altering forest ecosystem function and structure. Anticipating how changes in deposition and climate impact forests can inform decisions regarding these environmental stressors. Here, we used a dynamic soil-vegetation model (ForSAFE-Veg) to simulate responses to future scenarios of atmospheric deposition and climate change across 23 Northeastern hardwood stands. Specifically, we simulated soil percent base saturation, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), nitrate (NO3−) leaching, and understory composition under 13 interacting deposition and climate change scenarios to the year 2100, including anticipated deposition reductions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change–projected climate futures. Overall, deposition affected soil responses more than climate did. Soils recovered to historic conditions only when future deposition returned to pre-industrial levels, although anticipated CAA deposition reductions led to a partial recovery of percent base saturation (60 to 72%) and ANC (65 to 71%) compared to historic values. CAA reductions also limited NO3− leaching to 30 to 66% above historic levels, while current levels of deposition resulted in NO3− leaching 150 to 207% above historic values. In contrast to soils, understory vegetation was affected strongly by both deposition and climate. Vegetation shifted away from historic and current assemblages with increasing deposition and climate change. Anticipated CAA reductions could maintain current assemblages under current climate conditions or slow community shifts under increased future changes in temperature and precipitation. Overall, our results can inform decision-makers on how these dual stressors interact to affect forest health, and the efficacy of deposition reductions under a changing climate.

T1  - Enhanced leaf turnover and nitrogen recycling sustain CO2 fertilization effect on tree-ring growth
AN  - 2709212336
AB  - Whether increased photosynthates under elevated atmospheric CO2 could translate into sustained biomass accumulation in forest trees remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate how tree radial growth is closely linked to litterfall dynamics, which enhances nitrogen recycling to support a sustained effect of CO2 fertilization on tree-ring growth. Our ten-year observations in two alpine treeline forests indicated that annual (or seasonal) stem radial increments generally had a positive relationship with the previous year’s (or season’s) litterfall and its associated nitrogen return and resorption. Annual tree-ring width, annual litterfall and annual nitrogen return and resorption all showed an increasing trend during 2007–2017, and most of the variations were explained by elevated atmospheric CO2 rather than climate change. Similar patterns were found in the longer time series of tree-ring width index from 1986–2017. The regional representativeness of our observed patterns was confirmed by the literature data of six other tree species at 11 treeline sites over the Tibetan Plateau. Enhanced nitrogen recycling through increased litterfall under elevated atmospheric CO2 supports a general increasing trend of tree-ring growth in recent decades, especially in cold and nitrogen-poor environments.A ten-year dataset from the Tibetan Plateau shows a general increase in tree-ring growth that is largely explained by enhanced nitrogen recycling through increased litterfall under elevated atmospheric CO2.

T1  - Integrating blue: How do we make nationally determined contributions work for both blue carbon and local coastal communities?
AN  - 2690019801
AB  - Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCEs) help mitigate and adapt to climate change but their integration into policy, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), remains underdeveloped. Most BCE conservation requires community engagement, hence community-scale projects must be nested within the implementation of NDCs without compromising livelihoods or social justice. Thirty-three experts, drawn from academia, project development and policy, each developed ten key questions for consideration on how to achieve this. These questions were distilled into ten themes, ranked in order of importance, giving three broad categories of people, policy & finance, and science & technology. Critical considerations for success include the need for genuine participation by communities, inclusive project governance, integration of local work into national policies and practices, sustaining livelihoods and income (for example through the voluntary carbon market and/or national Payment for Ecosystem Services and other types of financial compensation schemes) and simplification of carbon accounting and verification methodologies to lower barriers to entry.

T1  - Shear-margin melting causes stronger transient ice discharge than ice-stream melting in idealized simulations
AN  - 2666795559
AB  - Basal ice-shelf melting is the key driver of Antarctica's increasing sea-level contribution. In diminishing the buttressing force of the ice shelves that fringe the ice sheet, the melting increases the ice discharge into the ocean. Here we contrast the influence of basal melting in two different ice-shelf regions on the time-dependent response of an isothermal, inherently buttressed ice-sheet-shelf system. In the idealized numerical simulations, the basal-melt perturbations are applied close to the grounding line in the ice-shelf's (1) ice-stream region, where the ice shelf is fed by the fastest ice masses that stream through the upstream bed trough and (2) shear margins, where the ice flow is slower. The results show that melting below one or both of the shear margins can cause a decadal to centennial increase in ice discharge that is more than twice as large compared to a similar perturbation in the ice-stream region. We attribute this to the fact that melt-induced ice-shelf thinning in the central grounding-line region is attenuated very effectively by the fast flow of the central ice stream. In contrast, the much slower ice dynamics in the lateral shear margins of the ice shelf facilitate sustained ice-shelf thinning and thereby foster buttressing reduction. Regardless of the melt location, a higher melt concentration toward the grounding line generally goes along with a stronger response. Our results highlight the vulnerability of outlet glaciers to basal melting in stagnant, buttressing-relevant ice-shelf regions, a mechanism that may gain importance under future global warming.

T1  - The climate crisis is also a child rights crisis
AN  - 2656859287
AB  - Furthermore, many international agreements, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, affirm countries’ commitments to a human rights-based approach to development and climate action.

[...]the negative impacts of climate change on children trigger obligations among those responsible, for both mitigation and adaptation.2 The RCPCH position statement says:

Climate change will further erode these rights.

[...]overwhelmingly, these children live in those parts of the world that have contributed the least to the climate crisis and in countries with the least resources to provide the critical services which are their right, much less to adapt current services to climate change.

[...]a committee member stated that ‘the collective nature of the causes of climate change must not absolve a State from its individual responsibility’.5 However, despite this encouraging ruling, the Committee explained in an open letter to the children and young people that the case was inadmissible because complaint procedures require all cases to be taken to the national courts first.6 Need for urgent, collective action The RCPCH recognises that climate change is an existential threat to the health and well-being of children and young people.

[...]in October 2020, the RCPCH joined the national health and academic alliances to declare a climate and ecological emergency requiring accelerated collaborative actions.

Governments should strengthen targets to end the use of fossil fuels in all sectors as part of their transition to clean renewable energy sources, including the immediate cessation of all fossil fuel exploration and subsidies. 3.

T1  - Assessing the potential for unaccounted emissions from bioenergy and the implications for forests: The United States and global
AN  - 2628035287
AB  - Development of the bioenergy sector is being actively pursued in many countries as a means to reduce climate change and fulfill international climate agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Although biomass for energy production (especially wood pellets) can replace carbon‐intensive fossil fuels, its net greenhouse gas impact varies, and the production of wood pellets can also lead to intensification in forest harvests and reduction of forest carbon stocks. Additionally, under specific conditions, emissions associated with imported biomass feedstocks may be omitted from national accounts, due to incompatibilities in accounting approaches. We assessed the risks and potential scale of emissions omitted from accounts (EOA) among key trading regions, focusing on the demand for wood pellets under different levels of climate mitigation targets. Our results suggest that the global production of wood pellets would grow from 38.9 to 120 Mton/year between 2019 and 2050 in a scenario that limits global mean temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre‐industrial levels. A large portion of this occurs in North America (36.8 Mton/year by 2050), Europe (47.6 Mton/year by 2050), and Asia (23.3 Mton/year by 2050). We estimate that in a 1.5°C scenario, global EOA associated with international trade of wood pellets has the potential to reach 23.81 MtCO2eq/year by 2030 and 69.52 MtCO2eq/year in 2050. Emissions resulting from European biomass energy production, based on wood pellet imports from the United States, may reach 11.68 MtCO2eq/year by 2030 and 33.57 MtCO2eq/year in 2050. The production of wood pellet feedstocks may also present a substantial carbon price arbitrage opportunity for bioenergy producers through a conjunction of two distinct GHG accounting rules. If this opportunity is realized, it could accelerate the growth of the bioenergy industry to levels that harm forests’ function as a carbon sink and omit actual emissions in national and global accounting frameworks.

T1  - Modelling the globalization-CO2 emission nexus in Australia: evidence from quantile-on-quantile approach
AN  - 2621930895
AB  - Sustainable development policies for achieving net-zero emissions require understanding the factors that influence carbon emissions. Capitalizing on the limitations of the existing literature, this study applies the quantile-on-quantile approach to investigate economic globalization’s impact on carbon emissions in Australia for 1970–2018. The results from the quantile-on-quantile revealed a positive feedback linkage between globalization and carbon emissions at all quantiles. The results further indicated that while there is a positive feedback linkage between economic growth and carbon emissions at most quantiles, a positive feedback interconnection exists between carbon emissions and coal consumption at all quantiles. As a robustness check, we employed the quantile regression test, and the results from quantile regression are consistent with the findings from the quantile-on-quantile approach. The consistency of the results suggests that these study findings are reliable and suitable for informing policies that seek to address carbon emissions in Australia. The policy implications for Australia are discussed.

T1  - Assessing the Area of Suitable Land for Climate Change Mitigation with Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) in Scotland
AN  - 2728498174
AB  - One of the key areas in which the United Kingdom government plans to achieve net zero, reduce GHG emissions and sequester carbon is through afforestation. Afforestation will also provide ecosystem services to society. The Scottish government’s target is to increase woodland cover in Scotland to 25% by 2050. In this study, a land suitability analysis was used to investigate the likelihood of achieving this target based on the biophysically suitable and available land considering the current policy constraints for planting Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) in Scotland. The results showed that about 19% of land area in Scotland is biophysically suitable for Sitka spruce and about 13% is biophysically suitable and available based on policy constraints. Thus, there is an opportunity for the Scottish government to increase the woodland cover in Scotland to 31.5% and exceed its 25% woodland target. However, for Scotland to achieve net zero by 2045, it will require that more trees be planted on higher-quality agricultural land, different from areas where trees are currently planted.

T1  - Techno-Economic Analysis of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems Designed for Electric Vehicle Charging: A Case Study from the United Arab Emirates
AN  - 2716531232
AB  - The United Arab Emirates is moving towards the use of renewable energy for many reasons, including the country’s high energy consumption, unstable oil prices, and increasing carbon dioxide emissions. The usage of electric vehicles can improve public health and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. Thus, the usage of renewable energy resources to meet the demands of electric vehicles is the major challenge influencing the development of an optimal smart system that can satisfy energy requirements, enhance sustainability and reduce negative environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to examine different configurations of hybrid renewable energy systems for electric vehicle charging in Abu Dhabi city, UAE. A comprehensive study was conducted to investigate previous electric vehicle charging approaches and formulate the problem accordingly. Subsequently, methods for acquiring data with respect to the energy input and load profiles were determined, and a techno-economic analysis was performed using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software. The results demonstrated that the optimal electric vehicle charging model comprising solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, batteries and a distribution grid was superior to the other studied configurations from the technical, economic and environmental perspectives. An optimal model could produce excess electricity of 22,006 kWh/year with an energy cost of 0.06743 USD/kWh. Furthermore, the proposed battery–grid–solar photovoltaics–wind turbine system had the highest renewable penetration and thus reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 384 tons/year. The results also indicated that the carbon credits associated with this system could result in savings of 8786.8 USD/year. This study provides new guidelines and identifies the best indicators for electric vehicle charging systems that will positively influence the trend in carbon dioxide emissions and achieve sustainable electricity generation. This study also provides a valid financial assessment for investors looking to encourage the use of renewable energy.

T1  - LAYERS: A Decision-Support Tool to Illustrate and Assess the Supply and Value Chain for the Energy Transition
AN  - 2679846364
AB  - Climate change mitigation strategies are developed at international, national, and local authority levels. Technological solutions such as renewable energies (RE) and electric vehicles (EV) have geographically widespread knock-on effects on raw materials. In this paper, a decision-support and data-visualization tool named “LAYERS” is presented, which applies a material flow analysis to illustrate the complex connections along supply chains for carbon technologies. A case study focuses on cobalt for lithium-ion batteries (LIB) required for EVs. It relates real business data from mining and manufacturing to actual EV registrations in the UK to visualize the intended and unintended consequences of the demand for cobalt. LAYERS integrates a geographic information systems (GIS) architecture, database scheme, and whole series of stored procedures and functions. By means of a 3D visualization based on GIS, LAYERS conveys a clear understanding of the location of raw materials (from reserves, to mining, refining, manufacturing, and use) across the globe. This highlights to decision makers the often hidden but far-reaching geo-political implications of the growing demands for a range of raw materials that are needed to meet long-term carbon-reduction targets.

T1  - Realising the Potential of Renewable Energy as a Tool for Energy Security in Small Island Developing States
AN  - 2663123574
AB  - Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are heavily dependent on the use of imported fossil fuels to address their energy needs. This has a negative impact on the environment, SIDS budgets, and energy security. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of renewable energy (RE) as a tool for energy security in SIDS. In this regard, using VOSviewer, a widely known software tool, two bibliometric analyses were performed with a focus on the literature that explores two intertwined issues: (i) the links between RE and energy security; and (ii) the implications of RE and energy security in SIDS. The results from the study show that RE can help SIDS enhance their energy security and assure long-term energy sustainability. In addition, the results show that with the reduction in the cost of batteries in the future, they will eventually replace diesel generators. Moreover, the study showed that renewable energy may assist SIDS in their long-term efforts to achieve food security. The analysis discusses the major obstacles and the potential solutions for the integration of RES into the energy generation of SIDS. The paper concludes with useful recommendations to help island nations reduce their carbon footprint.

T1  - A Qualitative Based Causal-Loop Diagram for Understanding Policy Design Challenges for a Sustainable Transition Pathway: The Case of Tees Valley Region, UK
AN  - 2653040613
AB  - The energy transition is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive and structured approach to policymaking. Such an approach is needed to ensure that transition pathways and policies enable greener energy alternatives whilst ensuring prosperity for people living in the region and limiting environmental degradation to the local ecosystem. This paper applies a qualitative approach based on systematic literature research and review analysis to identify and analyse previous work within this interdisciplinary field in order to understand the complexity of energy transitions and identify key variables and sub-sectors that need to be addressed by policymaking. The paper then looks at the problem from a regional level and uses the Tees Valley region in North East England as a reference case for the energy system and potential proposed policies for the energy transition. A system dynamics methodology was employed to help visualise and emphasise the major complexity of the energy transition and the challenges that policymaking needs to tackle for the successfully enable implementation and application of the energy transition policies. The results of this study identified that in relation to the Tees Valley energy system, its development and transition towards decarbonisation, the major challenge for the policymakers is to ensure that proposed policies foster growth in job creation without leading to job losses within the local employment market.

T1  - Climate Change and the Diversification of Green Social Capital in the International Political Economy of the Middle East and North Africa: A Review Article
AN  - 2649105589
AB  - This article critically reviews the idea of economic diversification of green social capital in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) through renewable and sustainable energy projects that strive to tackle climate change and alleviate the negative consequences of human interaction in the ecological system. The western dominance and monopolisation of natural resources has caused an unlevel playing field for development, economic advancement and climate change in the region through the imbalance of power in the oil market. The reliance on oil could affect the development in the region with long-term financial recession due to heavy reliance on the resource. These challenges posit a question for the Middle East: (1) how can the region adopt a transition to a diverse economic framework that is less reliant on oil, and (2) since the phenomenon of climate change does not discriminate its adverse effects on the global community, including the aspect of international political economy in the region, in what ways are the MENA nations planning to stimulate sustainable economic development via green social capital? Our review for these issues is based on a qualitative approach and is methodologically centred upon selected case studies and document analysis of literature on economic diversification and sustainable ecological innovations via green social capital enterprises in the MENA region. We argue that green social capital, as opposed to traditional capitalism, has positive effects in the MENA region such as creating new job opportunities, boosting the economy and developing knowledge on climate change. The green social capital approach is viewed to continue to have positive results in the region through investment, the collaboration between the public sector and private enterprises and creating innovative ideas. Green social capital is not perfect by any means, but the method is diverse from traditional capitalism which can benefit the population in the global south, particularly in the MENA region.

T1  - Sustainable Aviation—Hydrogen Is the Future
AN  - 2618269710
AB  - As the global search for new methods to combat global warming and climate change continues, renewable fuels and hydrogen have emerged as saviours for environmentally polluting industries such as aviation. Sustainable aviation is the goal of the aviation industry today. There is increasing interest in achieving carbon-neutral flight to combat global warming. Hydrogen has proven to be a suitable alternative fuel. It is abundant, clean, and produces no carbon emissions, but only water after use, which has the potential to cool the environment. This paper traces the historical growth and future of the aviation and aerospace industry. It examines how hydrogen can be used in the air and on the ground to lower the aviation industry’s impact on the environment. In addition, while aircraft are an essential part of the aviation industry, other support services add to the overall impact on the environment. Hydrogen can be used to fuel the energy needs of these services. However, for hydrogen technology to be accepted and implemented, other issues such as government policy, education, and employability must be addressed. Improvement in the performance and emissions of hydrogen as an alternative energy and fuel has grown in the last decade. However, other issues such as the storage and cost and the entire value chain require significant work for hydrogen to be implemented. The international community’s alternative renewable energy and hydrogen roadmaps can provide a long-term blueprint for developing the alternative energy industry. This will inform the private and public sectors so that the industry can adjust its plan accordingly.

T1  - Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Mitigation and Ecosystem Adaptation along Belt and Road Initiative
AN  - 2648818837
AB  - Since its launch in 2013, the Chinese Road and Belt Innitiative (BRI) has grown into a platform for any countries and regions that wish to participate, with global connectivity as the orienting goal. However, since its inception, concerns over the BRI’s potential impacts on ecology, environment and resilience, as well as its implications for global climate change and sustainability, have gathered force. As this thematic issue goes to press, these already complex BRI issues have been compounded by challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether and how the BRI can meet these challenges are questions worthy of deep exploration. This emerging BRI scholarship studied various aspects of BRI activities. However, major knowledge gaps remain regarding BRI impacts on GHG emission and on climate adaptation and sustainable resource management more broadly. To this end, this thematic issue aims to contribute to deeper understandings of climate and environmental changes along the BRI by bringing together state-of-art research and views on climate change patterns, trends, risks, impacts and adaptation.

AB  - The recent COP26 summit stressed that we are running out of time to cut carbon emissions and avert catastrophic climate change; concurrently, the spiralling cost of fossil fuels signals that demand for energy is far outstripping supply.

Historically, of course, such energy consumption is unprecedented.

[...]as recently as a couple of centuries ago, nearly all of humanity's energy needs were met by what today we would label as ‘renewable sources’: firewood, animals for traction and transport (see Taylor et al. this issue), watermills, windmills and human labour—both free and unfree.

In northern China, for example, coal was used for smelting during the Bronze Age,4 and its presence in small quantities on Romano-British sites suggests wide if low-level use across Rome's most northerly province.5 More intensive and widespread exploitation of fossil fuels, however, was restricted by the costs of extracting and transporting these geographically localised substances, especially when other more accessible sources of energy, such as wood, olive pressings, animal dung, or wind and water power, were readily available.

Industrial archaeologists have long studied the factories, transport infrastructure and material culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, illuminating the origins of the fossil fuel-based world of today.7 Contemporary archaeologists are now tracing the effects of present-day extractive and industrial processes, such as how global capital creates distinctive types of settlement and notions of domesticity.8 Although there is nothing historically comparable to the scale, speed and comprehensiveness of the energy revolution that will be required to achieve carbon net zero within the next few decades, archaeology nonetheless has a role to play in the decarbonisation of the contemporary world.
