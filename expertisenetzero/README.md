# Expertise Mapping: Net Zero in the North East of England


## Description
INE mapped the expertise in the North East region to identify scholars addressing net zero. This document describes a scoping review aimed at mapping research on net zero in the North East England.

## Goals: 
- Identifying expertise on Net Zero in the North East region
- - Mapping themes and research topics.
Period: 2018-2023 (aligned to the goal of finding the most recent literature and experts affiliated to the universities in the region – Commitment UK about Net Zero – 2021/Publications increased consistently from 2018 onwards).
Databases: Scopus and Web of Science

## Methods
Scoping review and bibliometrics

## Protocol
Search terms and filters:
-	 Tests:
o	Title/Abs/Keywords 1: 'net zero' or 'energy transition' or 'climate change' or 'decarbonisation' (the goal is to find the greatest number of publications related to net zero that might be helpful for policy purposes – hence, we employed broad terms)
o	Title/Abs/Keywords 2: 'carbon emissions' and 'transport' or 'energy' or 'waste' or 'housing' or 'land use' or 'food systems' or 'waste' (priorities for the region according to NZNE)
o	Title/Abs/Keywords 3: ‘net zero’ or ‘energy transition’ or ‘renewable energy’ 
-	Final search terms
o	Title/Abs/Keywords:
-	Affiliation: Northumbria University, Newcastle University, Durham University, Teesside University, Sunderland. Strategy: I used only the names 'norhumbria', 'newcastle' etc in the field affiliation (Scopus) - so that I would catch all the related expressions ('Newcastle University', 'Newcastle Business School', 'University of Newcastle'). In the case of Newcastle, there are another institution in Australia.
-	Country: To solve the problem above, I added 'United Kingdom' or 'England' or 'UK' as the affiliation country.
-	Period: 2018-2023. Justification: the goal is to find recent research. 2018 was chosen because it allows to check trends right before and after the pandemic – also the number of publications increased consistently from 2018 onwards. 
-	Databases: Scopus was chosen as the main database because it is a well-known and consolidated database with easy search mechanisms and file formats (as required by VOSviewer and R Bibliometrix). Also, it resulted in a greater number of publications. The platform has incorporated new mechanisms to find researchers.
